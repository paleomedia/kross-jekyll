**Snake River Alliance appeals plan for INL to process nuclear waste from 14 other facilities for storage in New Mexico.** DOE: &#8220;We feel that the Idaho facility is very well equipped to treat this waste,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It helps us get to our mission of safely cleaning up waste we have across (the country).&#8221; SRA: &#8220;DOE has a kind of pattern of digging a hole and then expecting the stars to align to get it out of the hole.&#8221; Poppino in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/05/20/news/local_state/137093.txt).
