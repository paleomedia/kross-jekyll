The authors of Amor and Exile are commemorating the first year since publication by hosting an Amazon Kindle Countdown Deal today, Saturday, May 31st, through Monday, June 2nd, 2014. 

We never would have guessed that a YEAR after delivering 635 books to Congress, immigration reform STILL wouldn&#8217;t have passed! But the fight still continues.

To help get the word out there to the American public who can help us win this fight, we&#8217;re practically giving it away copies of our Kindle version for $0.99 today, $1.99 tomorrow, and $2.99 on Monday on <a href="http://amzn.to/11dNDPd" target="_blank">the Kindle store</a>. Regular sales price is $7.99. Kindle apps are available for almost every mobile device and laptops.

Please tell all your friends why you think they should download a copy. Or if you haven&#8217;t yet, now&#8217;s a better time than ever to learn more about the laws affecting American families with undocumented spouses and their heartbreaking stories.
