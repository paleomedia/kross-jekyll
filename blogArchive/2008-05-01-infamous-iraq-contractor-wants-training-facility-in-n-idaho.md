**Blackwater Worldwide, the security firm accused of gunning down 17 Iraqis last year, wants to build a training facility in North Idaho.** Idaho police academy would be a tenant. Sheriff Rocky Watson: &#8220;The perception that our law enforcement officers will be trained by mercenaries is a problem. Our jobs are totally different. We&#8217;re not paramilitary. The perception is important to our customers.&#8221; Blackwater: We&#8217;re not mercenaries. San Diego [blocked a training center last year](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15127334). Marc Stewart, [CDA Press](http://www.cdapress.com/articles/2008/05/01/news/news02.txt).
