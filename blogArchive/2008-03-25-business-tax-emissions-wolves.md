After a mess of testimony against repeal of the personal property tax, a Senate committee voted to pass the bill onto the full Senate. Cities and counties are worried about repercussions to their budgets. 

Legislators hung around the halls this morning whilst their leaders tried to hash out some deals to get the session wrapped up&#8230;. One of them is on local option taxing and a Constitutional amendment. 

News on Paleo is shifting toward elections. Enough of this legislative stuff already&#8230;
