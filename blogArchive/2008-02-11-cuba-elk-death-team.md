  A profusion of bills were heard last week with a bunch on the docket this morning as a Legislative deadline to introduce stuff is upon them. An interesting, if self-serving poll finds majority support for road and transit taxes, including local option tax, which has not been addressed prior to today's committee deadline (bills can still be brought to a few, elite committees.)
  
  Talk last week on teacher pay turned to compromise measures after Luna met (again) with the Education committees. It looks like the provision to trade merit pay for teacher contracts will not fly.

A profusion of bills were heard last week with a bunch on the docket this morning as a Legislative deadline to introduce stuff is upon them. An interesting, if self-serving poll finds majority support for road and transit taxes, including local option tax, which has not been addressed prior to today&#8217;s committee deadline (bills can still be brought to a few, elite committees.)

Talk last week on teacher pay turned to compromise measures after Luna met (again) with the Education committees. It looks like the provision to trade merit pay for teacher contracts will not fly. Also a Cuba resolution, a pro forma elk bill and a new child death investigation program in today&#8217;s Newsrack&#8230;

**General Contractors&#8217; poll finds support for road, local option tax.** 62 percent in AGC poll say they support local sales tax hike for roads and transit. Otter pleased: &#8220;From what I know about it, folks seem to support my approach to addressing our transportation challenges. That&#8217;s encouraging.&#8221; Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/291442.html).

**iSTARS, union pay plan, not going anywhere.** Friday secret meeting with Super and Ed committee chairs yields stalemate. Rep. Nonini, House Ed: &#8220;There&#8217;s no support for the current bills in their current form.&#8221; And axing continuing contracts not going to fly either, but may be some other way to fire teachers in the works. Ferguson in the [LMT](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/14666/) [subscrip].

Tax revenue shortfall doom and gloom. Does $36 million short foreshadow slumping economy? On [Idaho Reports](http://idahoptv.org/idreports/irthisweek.cfm).

**Trail wants Pres., Congress to open trade with Cuba.** Bill would urge feds to change policy. Governor will likely support it, given his strong advocacy on Cuba. Ferguson in the [LMT](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/14680/) [subscrip]. Hoffman on [PaleoMedia.org](http://www.paleomedia.org/2008/02/10/trail-to-introduce-cuba-memorial/).

**Proposed team would investigate child deaths.** Idaho only state in the nation without one. Rep. Margaret Henbest, sponsor: &#8220;I think reviewing what happens drives policy in preventing deaths.&#8221; Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/290520.html).

**Bill would require warning of foreclosure scams.** Also requires a written contract from foreclosure rescue services and contracts in Spanish if needed. Banks don&#8217;t oppose. Estrella in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/290522.html). Carlson in the [IBR](http://www.idahobusiness.net/archive.htm/2008/02/08/Foreclosure-rescue-scams-targeted-by-Idaho-Senate-bill).

**Private elk hunt ban reintroduced.** No debate scheduled on &#8220;shooter bull&#8221; ban. Sen. David Langhorst: &#8220;I filed the bill just so it would get printed. I don&#8217;t want to go through the same fight as last year. I just want to keep this issue alive.&#8221; Citizen initiative down the road as well. Christensen in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/02/11/news/local_state/130597.txt).

**Beebe to challenge Thayn.** Three term Canyon County Commissioner Matt Beebe will run in District 11 against controversial freshman Steven Thayn. Cites transportation as a major issue: “One of the issues we all face is we have tremendous transportation problems. Earlier I heard a pretty grim report from one of the representatives about no money for some of the projects. That’s certainly something that needs to be addressed.” John Meyer in the [Press Tribune](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=3733).

**Rep. Brent Crane a dad.** After pastor prayed for them to get pregnant and have a boy, Cranes named son Keaton Ronald. Kendel Murrant in the [Press Tribune](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=3711) (baby pic).

**Idaho near bottom at protecting citizens from gun violence.** Brady Campaign report ranks Idaho low on most gun laws. Local law enforcement feels laws are adequate. Rich Greene in the [South Idaho Press](http://www.southidahopress.com/articles/2008/02/09/news/local/9689gunlaws.txt).

**Otter running government by phone.** From ranch in Star where he&#8217;s recovering from hip surgery. Speaker Denny: &#8220;It&#8217;s a little better when you can look him in the eye, but we&#8217;re getting by.&#8221; Pundits: Is he on meds? Hopkins in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/02/10/news/local_state/130511.txt).

**Gwartney provides insight into Otter admin.** Two millionaires living a cowboy fantasy. Lengthy profile of Otter&#8217;s head of Admin, who works for free. They ride together. Trophy wives. Look to private sector. Popkey in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/localnews/story/291426.html).

**36 Idaho school districts do random drug tests.** Health groups now say it&#8217;s not an effective tool to fight drugs and may cause harm. Blair Koch in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/02/11/news/local_state/130593.txt).

**Legislature trudges on&#8230;** No end in site. Big laws have not been introduced. Like road funding, Legislative pay&#8230; Hopkins in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/02/10/news/local_state/130553.txt).
