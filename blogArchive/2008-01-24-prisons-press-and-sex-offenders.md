Gov. Butch Otter began shopping his plan to begin immediate construction on a privately built and operated prison, but was met with some skepticism from Legislative leaders Wednesday. Funding for a new prison was not in Otter&#8217;s budget, but the state would not have to pay immediately if a prison company was contracted for the work. There is a lengthy piece of legislation that would authorize the privately run prison, but it has not been introduced yet. 

Also, House and Senate leaders questioned some of Otter&#8217;s other spending at an Idaho Press Club luncheon, the annual raft of sex offender bills are getting heard and ACLU chief Jack Van Valkenburgh is moving on in today&#8217;s Daily Newsrack. [updates will be posted throughout the morning.]

**Trimming of governor&#8217;s budget likely**. Legislative leaders voice concerns over economy at Press Club luncheon. Speaker Denney: &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of nervousness about funding that 3 percent that&#8217;s not going to be there.&#8221; College scholarship fund, state employee raises on the chopping block. Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/273834.html). 

**Otter shopping private private-private prison plan around the Annex.** Legislative leaders prefer state owned-private operated, but Otter wants &#8220;merchant&#8221; prison that will be privately built, owned and operated and stocked with out of state inmates. Initial study showed state-owned prison would be cheaper by 2019, but Otter revised the estimate out to 2042.

Bob Geddes: &#8220;What I&#8217;m worried about is the consequence of adding one more area to that particular law. It&#8217;s not really the issue, in my opinion. People get fired for various reasons but you can go to court for any reason.&#8221; 63 percent of Idahoans feel it should be illegal to fire someone for sexual orientation.

**Measure would limit siting of transitional housing for sex offenders.** Boise Rep. Lynn Luker: &#8220;There is a definite need for these homes, and this bill doesn&#8217;t try to say that there isn&#8217;t a need.
