Legislators return to work today with a number of hot bills on the table: a law to close primaries and one to make dog fighting a felony. A deal is reached on N.

And a Boise State University study shows most Idahoans want Craig to resign. <!--more--> [Unscientific aside: most Idahoans could not pick Craig out of a lineup&#8230; my wife was on a plane from Minneapolis with Craig this weekend and hardly anyone on the plane recognized the senior senator.]
