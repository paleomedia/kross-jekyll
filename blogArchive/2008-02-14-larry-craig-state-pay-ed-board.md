The Senate Ethics Committee has [chastised](http://ethics.senate.gov/downloads/pdffiles/craig.pdf) Sen. Larry Craig for ethics violations surrounding his June arrest. The decision comes with no penalty and Craig said in a brief statement he is staying put. No reaction yet from Idaho&#8217;s other Congressmen.

The House debated a whole bunch of bills yesterday, most of which moved on to the Senate. The Senate Education Committee is holding confirmation of the State Board of Education president hostage until it can get some answers. And state employees are gathering some momentum to oppose Otter&#8217;s plan for their health benefits&#8230;
