The Idaho Associated Press bureau put on a show Thursday with three panels including Senate and House leadership from both parties and discussions on transportation and schools. The panel generated stories on pavement and teacher pay and set the stage for some good battles in the session to come. Also, &#8217;07 was a record year for Idaho ag and Obama and Romney supporters were glued to CNN last night.<!--more-->

**Davis: Idaho needs a revolving door.** At least 8 former lawmakers or governor staff have moved into lobbying in the past year. Sen. Minority Leader Clint Stennett: &#8220;We&#8217;re using public money in order to help promote the careers and give these individuals the access that they have.&#8221; And Sen.

**Luna, IEA sqaure off on teacher pay**. Debate at AP Legislative preview forum focuses on teacher job security and basis for supplemental pay. Rep.

(And market scarcity) isn’t really a measure of excellence, it’s a measure of convenience.&#8221; Mike Butts in the [IPT](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=2868)&#8230; And Luna has heard a mouthful from both teachers and law makers but he&#8217;s sticking by the iSTARS (little i) and says it has the best chance of passage: &#8220;It would be a waste of our time, and everyone else&#8217;s time, to put forth a plan that isn&#8217;t going to go anywhere.&#8221; Anne Wallace Allen in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/254906.html).
