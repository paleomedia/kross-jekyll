**Senate candidate Jim Risch&#8217;s [claims](http://www.risch4idaho.com/multimedia.html) that he cut $200 million in taxes questioned.** State economist calls it a shift from property to sales tax. Democratic opponent Larry LaRocco: &#8220;It&#8217;s a lie.&#8221; GOP opponent Phenneger: &#8220;It&#8217;s a half-truth.&#8221; Risch: I was just talking about the one-day session where we cut the $200 mil in property tax in my ad, that&#8217;s all.
