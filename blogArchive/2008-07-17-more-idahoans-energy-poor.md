**Report: Increasing number of Idahoans are paying upwards of 10% of their income to energy costs.** Sen. Curt McKenzie says Legislature will consider local option tax again, incentives for wind and geothermal and help for home efficiency. Dar Olberding, grain producers: “The Legislature and the governor support renewable energy and efficiency, but development on the ground is lagging. I see more and more legislators who get it. I hope they will come to Boise with a sense of urgency.” Eric Muhr in the [Press Tribune](http://www.idahopress.com/news/?id=11727). Report [here](http://www.harvestcleanenergy.org/IdahoEnergy/).
