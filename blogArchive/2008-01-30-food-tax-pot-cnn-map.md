The House will take up a grocery tax bill this morning that apparently has GOP and governor&#8217;s support. House Democrats have an alternate, phased in removal of the &#8220;food&#8221; tax in the wings. Otter underwent hip surgery Tuesday, but was in charge of the state the whole time. A controversy between Fish and Game Commissioner Wright and Western Watershed&#8217;s Jon Marvel gets wide coverage. And Hailey is looking for answers on marijuana laws.
