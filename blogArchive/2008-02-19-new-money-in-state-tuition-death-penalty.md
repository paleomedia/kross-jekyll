excerpt: |
  Most used metaphor in today's papers: chopping block. Road funding, payroll, concurrent enrollment, energy center... all on the chopping block as the budget committee gets to work.
  
  Also, a bill to provide undocumented kids with instate tuition is being held up in committee, Karen McGee is stepping down... to spend time with her grandson (at least it's a specific reason), Fidel Castro also stepping down and college campuses will still be able to ban guns, for now. In today's <a href="http://www.paleomedia.org/2008/02/19/new-money-in-state-tuition-death-penalty/">Newsrack</a>... [did we mention you could send this email to a few buddies and help them get up to speed with the news every morning too?]
