**Judge Joel Horton will keep his Supreme Court bench by the slim margin of 276 votes.** Challenger John Bradbury will not demand a recount. Horton, after all-night election watch: &#8220;I&#8217;m truly just 20 percent of the vote on any particular issue. And the majority of the issues (Bradbury) presented will not come before the court; they&#8217;re legislative issues.&#8221; Allen in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/394562.html).
