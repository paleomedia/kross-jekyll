This morning the House Revenue and Taxation Committee approved a proposed Constitutional amendment that would require a 2/3 vote on any local option taxing district. The bill passed that committee on a party-line vote with Republicans supporting it and Democrats opposed.

In response to the bill, Sen. Diane Bilyeu, a Pocatello Democrat, is working on proposal that would write into the Constitution a required 2/3 Legislative vote to approve any future tax exemptions. This bill has not been drafted and Senate Democrats, who discussed the idea in a public caucus session Thursday, do not expect it to go far this session.
