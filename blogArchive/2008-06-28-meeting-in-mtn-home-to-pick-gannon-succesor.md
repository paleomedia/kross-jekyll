**District 23 GOP will meet to pick three possible successors to Sen. Tom Gannon, who died Tuesday.** Possible appointees include: Stephen Hartgen, Twin Falls business consultant and national GOP convention delegate; District 23 state Reps. Bert Brackett and Jim Patrick; Jeanne Gannon, wife of Tom Gannon; and Doran Parkins, who lost to Gannon in the primary. Nominations go to governor, who does not always pick the local party&#8217;s first choice. Gannon [had been sick for some time](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/06/25/news/local_state/139217.txt) and died of liver cancer.
