  A theme for last week could be: important bills hung up. A closed primary bill submitted by the Idaho GOP is not really what the primary closers wanted to see. It's hung up. A bill to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination in the workplace is hung up by lawmakers who with hangups. Road funding is hung up in the budget committee (like every year). Ethics probe of Craig, hung up. Nuclear plant in Payette, just hung.
  
  An interesting item in the Seattle Times: a train from Seattle to Salt Lake may be viable once again. Not hung up. In today's <a href="http://www.paleomedia.org/2008/01/28/closed-primaries-trains-and-roads/"> Newsrack...</a>

A theme for last week could be: important bills hung up. A closed primary bill submitted by the Idaho GOP is not really what the primary closers wanted to see. It&#8217;s hung up. A bill to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination in the workplace is hung up by lawmakers who with hangups. Road funding is hung up in the budget committee (like every year). Ethics probe of Craig, hung up. Nuclear plant in Payette, just hung.
