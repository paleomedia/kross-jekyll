Rep. Eric Anderson of Priest Lake agreed to be tased Thursday as a bill to regulate stun guns as concealed weapons died in committee. You can watch the whole thing on [Channel 2](http://www.2news.tv/news/16647241.html) (click on Watch Video)&#8230; Anderson was quite proud that he did not go into TITS (Taser Induced Tourette Syndrome).

Nampa Rep. Steven Kren, an electrician by trade, had sponsored a [bill](http://www3.idaho.gov/oasis/H0601.html) that would have made &#8220;conducted energy devices&#8221; &#8212; Tasers or stun guns &#8212; concealed weapons in Idaho. Kren declined to be shocked Thursday, telling PaleoMedia that the godfather of the bill does not get tased.

The bill died 7-7 in House State Affairs Thursday. The bill had the support of law enforcement.

Anderson, on the other hand, bragged about the experience all afternoon, though he ONLY lasted about 3 seconds. 

Another bill to prevent felons and a few other categories of people from carrying Taser-like weapons passed the Senate and is headed to the House.
