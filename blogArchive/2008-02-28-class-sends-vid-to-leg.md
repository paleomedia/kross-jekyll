The Senate this morning accepted major amendments to a bill brought by a group of school kids to reign in the absolute power of homeowner&#8217;s associations.

The bill will still get a full Senate debate, but the [ArtsWest](http://www.artswestschool.org/) students from Eagle, who have maxed out their out-of-classroom lobbying time, are reaching out to lawmakers via YouTube.

The old version of [Senate Bill 1399](http://www3.idaho.gov/oasis/S1399.html) is posted now, but it should be updated shortly. Sen. Mike Burkett told the Senate this morning that according to the class, only four lines of the original bill remain, but they are still pleased that it is under consideration.

The bill requires homeowners associations to open some aspects of their operations to the public.
