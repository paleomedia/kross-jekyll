**Obama tips hat to nonbelievers in inaugural** Paleo did not even notice, but Lloyd Lowe did in the[The Arbiter](http://media.www.arbiteronline.com/media/storage/paper890/news/2009/01/26/Opinion/.And-All.The.NonBelievers-3596455.shtml). &#8220;Obama said: &#8220;&#8230; We know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus &#8211; and non-believers.&#8221; Sorry Sikhs, Pagans, and Buddhists. Better luck next time.&#8221;
