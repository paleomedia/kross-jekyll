  Bikes anyone? Otter threw up his hands in disgust with the Legislature's failure to fund his $240 million hole in the state road system. Fine, reply lawmakers. We're outta here then... <p />
  
  But not so quick. Legislature could have a few more days work after the Senate trimmed back a repeal of business equipment taxes for the largest Idaho businesses, or for equipment intensive Idaho businesses, if you take the industry line. It now goes bak to the House for a grumpy approval. <p />
  
  Wolves are off the list, Ed Board says sorry and not much else in today's <a href="http://www.paleomedia.org/2008/03/28/no-roads-less-repeal-outie-500/">Newsrack</a>... <p />

Bikes anyone? Otter threw up his hands in disgust with the Legislature&#8217;s failure to fund his $240 million hole in the state road system. Fine, reply lawmakers. We&#8217;re outta here then&#8230; 

But not so quick. Legislature could have a few more days work after the Senate trimmed back a repeal of business equipment taxes for the largest Idaho businesses, or for equipment intensive Idaho businesses, if you take the industry line. It now goes bak to the House for a grumpy approval. 

Wolves are off the list, Ed Board says sorry and not much else in today&#8217;s Newsrack&#8230;

Bedke: &#8220;I think the net effect of it was, there&#8217;s probably enough legislators that didn&#8217;t need much of an excuse to be done, so I&#8217;m afraid that it will have that effect.&#8221; Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/335769.html). $200 million hole.
