**Vandals stuck a hose in the mail slot at the Idaho Human Rights Education Center before the weekend causing upwards of $1,000 damage.** Not thought to be a hate crime but the center is offering a reward for information on the crime. Will prosecute but willing to forgive. Moeller in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/localnews/story/369386.html).
