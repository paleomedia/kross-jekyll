**TF prisoners strike for better food.** One day strike meant to send a message to the new sheriff. Inmate Terry Knudesen: &#8220;There&#8217;s a new sheriff in town. My family voted for the new sheriff, we&#8217;re hoping it&#8217;s going to change something.&#8221; Tom Carter is new TF County Sheriff, possibly first hunger strike in Idaho jail in recent memory.
