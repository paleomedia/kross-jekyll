**State schools chief Tom Luna in CDA touting progress at Legislature.** Luna: &#8220;iSTARS was the closest Idaho has ever come to an improved teacher pay plan. It failed to pass the Senate by just one vote. I don&#8217;t consider that a failure.&#8221; No merit pay plan. No concurrent enrollment. But there&#8217;s going to be a study. Dolan, [CDA Press](http://www.cdapress.com/articles/2008/04/16/news/news05.txt).
