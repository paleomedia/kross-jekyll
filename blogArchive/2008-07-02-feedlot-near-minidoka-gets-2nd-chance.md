**Big Sky Farms won appeal after Jerome County denied them a permit for a megadairy near the Minidoka Internment National Monument.** Court says county did not base its decision on existing zoning laws, just on a general plan. No further public hearing necessary. Decision could come in August. Poppino in the Times-News.</p>
