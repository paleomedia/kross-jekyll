**Idaho writer, outdoorsman, dies in his boat.** Bill Studebaker died in a kayaking accident on the South Fork of the East Fork of the Salmon River, near Yellow Pine. Friend Rick Ardinger, Idaho Humanities Council: &#8220;No writer is better identified with Idaho than he was. He felt that geography really did influence Western expression. He wrote about deserts, rivers, the landscape. There&#8217;s no other writer in the state we can call the true poet laureate of Idaho.&#8221; David Cooper in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/07/08/news/top_story/139977.txt).
