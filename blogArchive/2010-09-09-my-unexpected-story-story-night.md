All of a sudden story telling is so hot. At one point in my life—pre-journalism, actually—I was full of stories and even thought of &#8220;griot&#8221; as a profession. But now that I think back, once I became a professional journalist, the stories kind of dried up. I&#8217;m not sure exactly why. Maybe the rigors of journalistic writing sapped all my ability to spin a yarn or the strict adherence to facts and concomitant fear of relying on the reporter&#8217;s own knowledge base in reporting a story robbed me of my oral history. Even my kids noticed that my stories were pretty lame; my wife has kicked my storytelling ass for five years.

But now that I&#8217;m independent again, I am all of a sudden full of tales. And I&#8217;m not the only one. Hundreds of people have been showing up to tell and hear stories at Boise&#8217;s [Story, Story Night](http://www.storystorynight.org/press/page/2/). I kept hearing about the event, which takes place monthly at the Linen Building. It goes like this: a few pros tell a tell, related to a theme and then they pick names from a hat and Jack or Jill Boise get five minutes to wow the audience with how cool they were way back when. I just kept missing the event. Until August.

I biked down to the Linen District, forgot a lock and left my bike on a rack hoping for the best. I was late as usual. The topic was Dog Days of Summer, and I thought back to my best summer &#8230; which was also the first time I laid eyes on the Salmon River. So I uncharacteristically threw my name in the hat thinking there would be little chance I&#8217;d get called up. I am the kind of person who likes to observe for a while before jumping into the fray, but I was feeling a little on the edge. And then, after the fist storyteller did a bang up job talking about a summer down south, the woman running the show called my name. Oops.

So here&#8217;s what I came up with. A bit rushed at the end, but I like it. I thought I would sound all nervous because my knees were involuntarily buckling the whole time, but I actually sound somewhat relaxed.

I didn&#8217;t win, but you can hear the story slam winner in [iTunes by clicking here](http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/id385163965#). A few younger people came up to me after the show and asked what Earth First! was/is. None of my students in my college composition class could place it either, though one did shout out &#8220;Treehuggers!&#8221; That about sums it up.

I have to say, getting up in front of a couple hundred mostly strangers (if there is such a concept in Boise) was a very liberating thing to do and I highly recommend it. It was also liberating to tell an Idaho audience that yes, it was Earth First! that brought me to Idaho in the first place. I&#8217;ve told very few people that over the years but it&#8217;s true. I&#8217;m still nostalgic for the Cayuga chapter actually. Shh. Don&#8217;t tell anyone.
