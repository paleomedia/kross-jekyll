The Idaho Legislature **changed the definition of hazardous waste** in &#8217;01 for US Ecology according to the [MountainGoat Report](http://mountaingoatreport.typepad.com/the_mountaingoat_report/2008/05/the-idaho-state.html). The company returned to the Capitol in &#8217;02 and &#8217;04 winning reduced fees both times. Retired Boise Sen. Cecil Ingram was the only vote against the original bill.

**MountainGoat**: &#8220;According to the Statesman, &#8216;company officials say the more money American Ecology makes, the more the state of Idaho benefits.&#8217; With these numbers it seems the more money American Ecology makes, the more money American Ecology makes.&#8221;
