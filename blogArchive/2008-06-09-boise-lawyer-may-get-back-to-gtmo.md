**Boise lawyer David Nevin says Bush pushing for Guantanamo Bay convictions before he leaves office.** Nevin had five hour meeting with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who rejected his counsel. Nevin: &#8220;This is not a fair proceeding. This is a show trial, and it&#8217;s a secret trial. The United States of America is not going to look good at the end of this.&#8221; Popkey in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/localnews/story/403333.html).
