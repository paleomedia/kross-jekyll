**Grant drops out of 1st CD race.** Larry Grant: &#8220;I’d love to be going head-to-head with Bill Sali. But what might have been a contentious primary wouldn’t have been useful in the long run. Bill Sali has been getting a pass for two months now while Democrats talk about who runs against him.&#8221; Endorses Minnick. AP in the [Press Tribune](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=7496). **Sali says Minnick is like Pelosi. Sali still has a primary. Minnick doesn&#8217;t.** Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/349071.html).
