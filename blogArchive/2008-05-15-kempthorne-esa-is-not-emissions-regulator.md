**Sec. of Interior Dirk Kempthorne agrees to list polars, but does not want ESA used to regulate carbon emissions.** Kempthorne: &#8220;Listing the polar bear as threatened can reduce avoidable losses of polar bears. But it should not open the door to use the ESA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, power plants, and other sources. That would be a wholly inappropriate use of the ESA.&#8221; Bolstad and Barker in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/localnews/story/381842.html).
