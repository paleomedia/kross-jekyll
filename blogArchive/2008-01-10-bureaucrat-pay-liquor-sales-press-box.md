Gov. Otter&#8217;s pay plan for state workers will raise salaries and cut benefits in order, the thinking goes, to attract younger workers who don&#8217;t care about their benefits as much. Idaho schools get more failing grades on national study. And, big surprise, Capitol renovation costs are up.

**Otter wants newer, younger state workers.** Raise pay, cut bennies. Admin Chief Mike Gwartney: &#8220;Basically, we&#8217;re saying, &#8216;Take the state out of the over-65 retiree business.'&#8221; Miller, AP in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/260343.html). Samantha Wright on [Boise State Radio](http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/idaho/news.newsmain?action=article&ARTICLE_ID=1209326&sectionID=1).

**Otter to bring tribal fuel tax deals to Legislature.** St. Maries Rep. Dick Harwood: &#8220;I don&#8217;t see where we did any negotiation, I really don&#8217;t. They just spend the money any place they want to.&#8221; Russell in the [Spokesman](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/idaho/topstory.asp?ID=227145).

**Study: Idaho teachers paid on par with other professionals.** Accountants, programmers, architects make about the same according to [Ed Week](http://www.edweek.org/media/ew/qc/2008/18shr.id.h27.pdf) study. Not mentioned: Idaho scores D+ overall for schooling (on par with national grade of C). Bill Roberts in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/260342.html). State Dept of Ed. not surprised at the score. Jodi Walker in the [LMT](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/13272/).

**Energy Tsar flooded with power proposals.** Paul Kjellander: “There are no silver bullets, but that doesn’t mean we do nothing. Conservation and demand-side efficiency gains are available “low-hanging fruit.” Carlson in the [IBR](http://www.idahobusiness.net/archive.htm/2008/01/09/Energy-official-Baseload-options-few).

**Tax credit changes proposed.** Interim committee suggests eliminating some tax credits including broadband, charitable donations, caskets. Davidson in the [Post Register](http://www.postregister.com/story.php?accnum=1035-01102008&today=2008-01-10%2000:00:00).

**7 grumbling reporters.** It&#8217;s tight, but there is still press access to the floor. Dean Ferguson in the [LMT](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/13270/). And a coat rack theft [solved](http://spokesmanreview.com/blogs/boise/archive.asp?postID=6819).

**State liquor sales up 90 percent.** In past five years. And they&#8217;re buying the good stuff. AP in the [Press Tribune.](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=2997)

**Talk about the family.** Was all talk, no bills. Thayn keeps getting ink though. Hopkins in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/01/10/news/local_state/128388.txt).

**East Idaho may get vet cemetery.** It&#8217;s in Otter&#8217;s budget, but no site has been located. Phil Davidson in the [Post-Register](http://www.postregister.com/story.php?accnum=1002-01102008&today=2008-01-10%2000:00:00).

**Dems throw stones, Moyle winces.** Jaquet: &#8220;It has to change in Eagle and Canyon County for us to win statewide. You can&#8217;t just have legislators from Boise.&#8221; Popkey in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/260347.html).

**SUV owners unite.** Eagle man touts SUV safety, pro-choice for cars. Moeller in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/eyepiece/story/260336.html).
