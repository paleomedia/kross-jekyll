**Rosemary P. Ardinger, Boise County Planning and Zoning Commissioner and former Department of Education administrator is challenging Mountain Home Republican Milton Peter &#8220;Pete&#8221; [Nielsen](http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=18080) in November.** Ardinger, a Democrat who lives off of Highway 21, worked for three state supers, wants to bring education knowledge to Legislature. Ardinger: &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen too many bad examples in other states where sprawl has overrun infrastructure. I&#8217;ll be a diligent voice for responsible growth, quality education, quality of life, and the economic benefits growth can bring.&#8221; Nielsen is a farmer and insurance agent from Mountain Home who wears awesomely polyester suits.
