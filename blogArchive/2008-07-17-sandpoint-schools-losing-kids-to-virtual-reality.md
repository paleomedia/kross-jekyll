**Sandpoint public school enrollment down, chart, virtual, private schools swell.** Home school parents use virtual schools for curriculum help. Parent: &#8220;Sometimes I&#8217;ll quiz him on things while we&#8217;re throwing the football back-and-forth. You can&#8217;t do that in most classrooms.&#8221; Part of a three-part series, but not much from the depressed &#8220;traditional&#8221; school people.
