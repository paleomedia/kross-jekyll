Micron announced intentions to build a new chip plant in Boise as it continues talks with a Taiwanese rival and as a bill to end or otherwise curtail Idaho&#8217;s personal property tax hits the Legislature.

And in other corporate shenanigans, IF skin product magnate Frank VanderSloot flew 10 lawmakers home last week to a GOP event on the eve of a vote on his noncompete bill in the Senate.

A dozen lawmakers still can&#8217;t even get a vote on daycare standards, pre-K bill held for another year on purpose and grocery tax relief passes anti-tax tax committee in today&#8217;s Newsrack (pass it on&#8230;)

No timeline set. AP in the [Argus](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/ID_MICRON_EXPANSION_IDOL-?SITE=ORONT&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT).[KTVB](http://www.ktvb.com/news/localnews/stories/ktvbn-mar0308-micron_expands.1b95cd45.html) first. **Statesman not invited.** Micron announced expansion in 2005 and got tax breaks through the Legislature. $282 million property tax exemption in &#8217;07.

**Grocery tax relief bill passes Rev & Tax.** Some support from governor, Democrats, House leaders. $50 credit for some poor. $30 for rest. Will increase over the years. Lenore: “If we go ahead with this bill, it would be like throwing a pound of hamburger to a junkyard dog to get him off your tail.” Russell in the [Spokesman](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/breaking/story.asp?ID=13933).

**Amending conservation easements to death.** Roberts leads effort to kill widely supported conservation credit bill through amendment to five-year easements. Bedke: &#8220;The Nature Conservancy is on the moderate end of a bunch of quite rabid folks who want to exchange their management for mine and get me off.&#8221; Conservancy in bed with cattlemen, farm bureau, food producers. Ferguson in the [LMT](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/15808/) [subscrip].

**Catch a flight, end abortion.** GOP members cut House Health and Welfare abortion coercion debate short so they could catch a flight to a party.

**&#8220;They hitched a ride.&#8221;** Ten Republican lawmakers flown in two corporate jets to Idaho Falls on eve of Melaleuca noncompete bill vote in the Senate. Coincidence? Maybe&#8230; but flight should cost thousands and how will it be disclosed. Miller, AP in the [Press Tribune](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/ID_XGR_PRIVATE_JET_IDOL-?SITE=IDNCP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT).

**Daycare [standards](http://www3.idaho.gov/oasis/S1376.html) dies without vote.** Chairman Patti Anne Lodge refuses vote on basic, minimal, daycare bill citing fiscal responsibility. Lodge: “My only promise to my constituents was that I would be mindful of their tax dollars.” Corder promises safety: “They can’t pass background checks, and yet we allow them to take care of children, we allow that.&#8221; Russell in the [Spokesman Review](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/breaking/story.asp?ID=13940). **Fourth year in a row.** Sponsors Corder and Sayler agreed to have the bill held in committee.

**Burkett asks committee to hold early ed bill.** Boise Senator wants to vet the bill with business groups before trying to get it through the Legislature. Bill would provide seed money for pilot pre-K programs at district level, but would not require any district to offer it. Would be expanded in 2012.

**It&#8217;s not a problem, but let&#8217;s make some money anyway.** Committee buys the greenhouse gas avoiding industry argument. Bill asks DEQ and governor to report back on emissions and suggest clean energy projects. Rep. Sharon Block: &#8220;Gentlemen, there&#8217;s a gold rush on the horizon and we in Idaho have the gold.&#8221; Ferguson in the [LMT](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/15809/) [subscrip]. **State energy plan calls for it.** Hopkins in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/03/04/news/local_state/132119.txt).

**Medicare requirement for retirees proposed.** Bill would force state retirees to take Medicare once eligible. Also forces Dept. of Administration to consult with lawmakers, courts, the governor and the agencies before proposing health plan changes.
