  <strong>McKenzie kills Sudan divestment bill</strong>. Nampa Sen. Curt McKenzie, former co-sponsor can't decide where the line is, votes down targeted divestment of PERSI funds.

A powerful (as in compelling, not corrupt) effort to force Idaho&#8217;s retirement fund to drop a few companies that do business with the Sudanese government failed Wednesday in the Senate State Affairs Committee. Chairman Curt McKenzie, once a sponsor of the bill, sided with the money folks, arguing that it was a slippery slope to pick and choose causes for divestment.

Midwives, OBs packed the house to debate the merits of licensing midwifery in the state. Vote delayed due to the hour. A real estate price disclosure bill passed committee after 17 years, Dairymen are taking up the immigration debate and Head Start funding is on the line&#8230; in today&#8217;s [NewsRack](http://www.paleomedia.org/2008/02/21/sudan-dies-midwife-debate-home-prices/).
