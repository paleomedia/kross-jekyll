**Last log rolled through the DeArmond Stud Mill, in Couer d&#8217;Alene since 1958.** 70 mill workers out. Planer Manager Dave Spuhler: &#8220;When you&#8217;re putting out 300,000 feet a day and nobody&#8217;s buying, you can&#8217;t keep running.&#8221; Rick Thomas in the [CDA Press](http://www.cdapress.com/articles/2008/05/14/news/news01.txt).
