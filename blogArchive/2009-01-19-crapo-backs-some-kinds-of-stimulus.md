**Sen. Mike Crapo, who told us last week he is skeptical of federal stimulus spending, [tells the Associated Press](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/6420ap_wa_energy_cleanup.html) he likes fed money for nuke cleanup.** Crapo in Seattle P-I: &#8220;This is exactly the kind of thing a stimulus package should be composed of.&#8221; Crapo to Hoffman in yet unpublished interview: &#8220;My belief is that the notion that we can spend ourselves into prosperity is one that is not valid.&#8221; $6 billion is on the table for cleanup spending as part of stimulus package; Crapo and Sen. Jim Risch are signed on. [H to the T](http://www.idahobusiness.net/archive.htm/2009/01/19/Idahos-congressmen-support-nuke-clean-up-bill).
