**Lt. Gov. Jim Risch will air his tax cut ad again, claiming $200+ million in cuts during his tenure as gov.** Does not mention his concomitant sales tax hike. Risch: &#8220;I said it then, I mean it now, and you&#8217;re going to hear it again in the election.&#8221; LaRocco&#8217;s got one too that only mentions the sales tax hike, not the property tax cut part. LaRocco: &#8220;He said he wouldn&#8217;t raise taxes, and he raised sales taxes on people across the board and working families.&#8221; Russell in the [Spokesman](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/idaho/topstory.asp?ID=254469).
