Conservative, former Utah governor Lane Beattie was at the Statehouse Thursday talking about how important it is to raise taxes for transportation infrastructure. Senate transpo committee impressed, but House leadership still skeptical.

Also, Post Register reporter asks governor&#8217;s office about adding sexual orientation to Idaho Human Rights Act and gets a vaguely supportive response, teacher pay plan public hearings end with full house and Tamarack is fined for stormwater runoff violations. Big fine.
