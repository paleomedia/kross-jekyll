  News that Mitt Romney, who had garnered scads of support in Idaho, was dropping out spread quickly through the Statehouse Annex Thursday. Many of the officials who had backed him quickly jumped on the McCain bandwagon.
  
  A December decline in personal income tax collections for the state made the budget committee fidget, or feign fidgeting at least and inspired the governor, still recovering from hip surgery, to issue a lengthy op-ed supporting his employee compensation proposal.
  
  Also, Dennis Lake, chairman of the House Revenue and Tax committee, suffered a minor stroke and had to be wheeled off the floor in the middle of debate. He smiled and waved to "my fans" as he was taken to the elevator. He is reported to be undergoing tests at a Boise hospital.

News that Mitt Romney, who had garnered scads of support in Idaho, was dropping out spread quickly through the Statehouse Annex Thursday. Many of the officials who had backed him quickly jumped on the McCain bandwagon.

A December decline in personal income tax collections for the state made the budget committee fidget, or feign fidgeting at least and inspired the governor, still recovering from hip surgery, to issue a lengthy op-ed supporting his employee compensation proposal. 

Also, Dennis Lake, 70, chairman of the House Revenue and Tax committee, suffered a minor stroke and had to be wheeled off the floor in the middle of debate. He smiled and waved to &#8220;my fans&#8221; as he was taken to the elevator. He is reported to be undergoing tests at a Boise hospital.
