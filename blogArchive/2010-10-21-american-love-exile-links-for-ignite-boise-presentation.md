Tonight I am &#8220;performing&#8221; the first public presentation of my research to the [Ignite Boise](http://igniteboise.com) crowd at the Egyptian Theater in Boise. It is a crowd heavy in tech, with a slightly palpable conservative bent &#8230; I&#8217;m thinking of making my next Ignite Boise pitch an analysis of the politics of Ignite Boise, but that&#8217;s a different story.

It&#8217;s also a free event, with beer, tailored to the short attention span set (AKA Twitter crowd). In other words, I have 5 minutes to convey 10 million years or so of immigration love stories. So I&#8217;m relying on some racy mental images in order to grab the crowd&#8217;s attention. But if anyone is interested in reading a bit deeper in this field, here are a few links I mention in my presentation.

For Census numbers, see:

  * [This recent study from the Pew Hispanic Center](http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=125) discusses unauthorized (their term) immigrants and their U.S. born children, and gives some clues as to mixed-status couples. I am working on crunching more Census numbers, but need some new database skills first. Pew is the go-to source for [immigration-related data](http://pewhispanic.org/topics/?TopicID=16). 
  * Gary Gates&#8217; [BI-NATIONAL SAME-SEX UNMARRIED PARTNERS IN CENSUS 2000:  
    A demographic portrait](http://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute//publications/Binational_Report.pdf) with Gates&#8217; updated 2008 numbers in news reports [here](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/10/16/gay_couples_take_on_an_immigrant_divide/) and [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/12/AR2010091204159.html).

Love Exile (my term) blogs:

Pop culture references:

  * Elizabeth Gilbert&#8217;s latest book [Committed](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/01/11/100111crbo_books_levy).
