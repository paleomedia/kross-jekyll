**On eve of contracting out prison beds from a soon-to-be-built private Power County lockup, IDOC warden says Idaho has 4th fastest growing criminal justice system in the nation.** IDOC&#8217;s Randy Blades: “One in 34 Idaho males are in prison, on probation, or on parole. We’re expecting 5,000 more inmates in the next 10 years.” County wants to house 250 prisoners for the state. Save 50 beds for local drunks, etc. [Power County Press.](http://www.press-times.com/Press%207-02-08/new%20jail.html)
