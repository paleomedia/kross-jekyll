excerpt: |
  Idaho's colleges and universities pitched the budget committee Tuesday and got a fairly warm, backslapping reception. U of I president pointed out that a quarter of the legislature graduated from Moscow. Also, the ACLU is still supporting Larry Craig in Minnesota, whether he likes it or not. And we may soon be able to buy tequila on Election Day... <p />

  <strong>ACLU joins Craig appeal.</strong> Would it have been disorderly conduct if they were sitting on bar stools?
