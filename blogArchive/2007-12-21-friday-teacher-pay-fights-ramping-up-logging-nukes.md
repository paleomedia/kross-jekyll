There has been surprisingly little commentary on Supt. Luna&#8217;s plan to pay teachers more in exchange for their contract rights, but groups of teachers are starting to meet, like [**this**](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/12425/) group in Lewiston, and they are not too happy about it&#8230;

Also, a state written roadless plan that was widely praised during the Risch admin is finally released, and, surprise, it doesn&#8217;t look so good to enviros now. Risch, meanwhile, has been in DC with Craig. And a nuke plant meeting in Payette draws 400 people. 400.
