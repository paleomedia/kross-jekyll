This site has admittedly been pretty sporadic for a few months. We&#8217;ve been dealing with a new baby, a new job and trying to get in shape for elk season. So thanks to all the folks that keep checking back.

You may be interested in a new blog that is part of my day job. I call is citydesk (lower case please) and it is a mix of Boise, Boise Valley and state news that comes across our radar down at the Boise Weekly offices. You can <del datetime="2008-08-23T02:37:15+00:00">take a peak today</del>check it out [here](http://citydesk.boiseweekly.com), <del datetime="2008-08-23T02:37:15+00:00">but</del> set your bookmarks for citydesk.boiseweekly.com&#8230; 

I am going to keep PaleoMedia.org going because I still think it&#8217;s a good idea. But I encourage you to check back maybe once a week rather than every day. Maybe consider it like your Sunday paper, without the paper&#8230; We&#8217;ll have lots more stuff on here during the legislative session of course and maybe some new features.
