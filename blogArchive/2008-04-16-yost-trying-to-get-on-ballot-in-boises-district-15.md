**Matt Yost, first time candidate for Legislature, fighting disqualification.** He was not registered to vote in the district for a year, though he has lived there. Six candidates disqualified by Secretary of State for carpetbagging. Yost is fighting for chance at Andreason. Andreason: &#8220;I&#8217;m dealing with the matter like I don&#8217;t have an opponent.&#8221; Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/353371.html).
