Everyone is doing their Minnick will get along just fine with the rest of the delegation stories.<!--more-->

Betsy Russell at the Spokesman says [national Dems will give Minnick some leeway](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/idaho/story.asp?ID=268072) to maneuver in his red district.

Lora Volkert, [writing for BW](http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A318998), has Crapo, Simpson and Sen.-elect Risch on Minnick: &#8220;We will work together across the board in Idaho&#8217;s interest.&#8221;

And Popkey at the Statesman has [Otter giving Minnick advice](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/565300.html): Go Blue Dogs.
