With about six weeks to go until Idaho’s Primary Elections, PaleoMedia.org is picking the 10 hottest races across the state. We will be covering these races here and on the [forums](http://www.paleomedia.org/forums), so jump in and tell us what’s happening in your neighborhood.

  1. Former Coeur d’Alene schools superintendent **David Rawls** is challenging **Rep. Phil Hart** in the District 3 primary. Hart holds some [extreme views](http://www.constitutionalincome.com/) on things like taxes – like they do not necessarily have to paid – and owes thousands of dollars to the [Uncle Sam](http://www.ktvb.com/news/localnews/stories/ktvbn-feb1608-hart_irs.cb3f730e.html). Rawls’ Republican bona fides have been [called into question](http://opencda.com/?p=303). Discuss [here](http://www.paleomedia.org/forums/forum.php?id=2). 
  2. In Caldwell and parts south, former State Department of Agriculture director **Pat Takasugi** is challenging fondue purveyor and [commie fighter](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=3123) **Curtis &#8220;Curt&#8221; Bowers**. Otter passed over Takasugi and tapped Bowers last year to fill Caldwell doc Bob Ring&#8217;s seat when Ring retired mid-term. Discuss [here](http://www.paleomedia.org/forums/forum.php?id=3).
  3. The large SW Idaho district that starts in Nampa and heads west to Emmett has a good three-way primary race with a former legislator and a well-known Canyon County commissioner vying to take out **Steven Thayn**, perhaps the state&#8217;s most socially conservative lawmaker. **Matt Beebe** is a county commissioner who is well-connected in the Canyon County GOP and **Gary Bauer** served in the Legislature in &#8217;03-&#8217;04. Discuss [here](http://www.paleomedia.org/forums/forum.php?id=4).
  4. Three powerful Republicans are challenging **Sen. Stan Bastian** in Eagle and West Boise in a district that is experiencing rapid growth and changing demographics. Attorney **Saundra McDavid** lost a tight race for Eagle&#8217;s mayor last fall. **Henry Kulczyk** is a former state rep and frequent conservative commentator on [Idaho Public Television](http://www.idahoptv.org/idreports/panelists.cfm). And **Chuck Winder** is a well-connected business man who once ran for Boise mayor. Discuss [here](http://www.paleomedia.org/forums/forum.php?id=5).
  5. In the same district, District 14, three Democrats signed up to challenge House Majority Leader **Mike Moyle**. One has already dropped out. Now unknowns **Glida Bothwell** and **Michelle Waddell** will go head to head in May for the chance to debate Moyle. An opportunity that the three Republicans running for the Senate seat passed up. Discuss [here](http://www.paleomedia.org/forums/forum.php?id=6).
  6. In Boise&#8217;s District 18 two powerful Republican women want to challenge freshman Rep. Brandon Durst. **Julie Ellsworth**, a former legislator and **Gail Hartnett**, who has the backing of the deep-pocketed Realtors Association will face off on May 27. Discuss [here](http://www.paleomedia.org/forums/forum.php?id=8).
  7. In another gubernatorial appointment face-off, **Rep. Mark Snodgrass** is challenging **Sen. Shirley McKague** for Meridian&#8217;s Senate seat. McKague rose to the Senate last year on an Otter appointment when Sen. Gerry Sweet resigned. Transportation, immigration and liquor laws will make for interesting debate here. [Discuss](http://www.paleomedia.org/forums/forum.php?id=9).
  8. In Mountain Home, a conservative [blogger](http://www.claytoncramer.com/weblog/blogger.html) **Clayton Cramer**, is taking on **Sen. Tim Corder** who has been very active on tax reform and outspoken on human rights. Cramer has already been blogging the race and Corder, as far as we can tell, does not have a Web site. Discuss [here](http://www.paleomedia.org/forums/forum.php?id=10).
  9. Three Republicans are challenging **Rep. Tom Loertscher** in Idaho&#8217;s easternmost district. **Allen Harrison**, V**. Elliott Larsen** and **Nancy J. Nead** would like to replace Loertscher. Discuss [here](http://www.paleomedia.org/forums/forum.php?id=13). 
 10. Three-way rematch down to two in Idaho Falls. Perrenial candidate Mike Adams already dropped out (again), but either **Ann Rydalch**, a former legislator or **Erik Simpson**, a former journalist who works at INL will be the next Idaho Falls Rep. Discuss [here](http://www.paleomedia.org/forums/forum.php?id=11).
