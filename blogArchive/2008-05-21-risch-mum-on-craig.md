**Candidate Jim Risch has nothing to say about Sen. Larry Craig.** Risch: “There’s nothing I can say about that situation that would advance the matter. I’m looking forward, I’m not looking backward.” Candidate Neal Thompson: &#8220;Neal’s not gonna go there. He’s got to walk his own line.&#8221; Others in the pack: Craig done good for Idaho.
