**The Boise police are investigating a mysterious break-in at Larry LaRocco&#8217;s Boise campaign offices.** Nothing was taken in the break-in and LaRocco&#8217;s Democratic Senate campaign is suggesting it could have been politically motivated. Manager Bob Stout: â€œWe will not know whether this was a politically motivated break-in or just a random act of senseless violence until the Boise police conclude their investigation.&#8221; [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/371533.html).
