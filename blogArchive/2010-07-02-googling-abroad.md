Just figured out how to Google virtually from Mexico, or any other locale. Just go to <http://www.google.com.mx/> and surf as if you were in Mexico (h/t [Boise State Green Guy in Bilbao](http://boisestategreenguy.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/google-en-espana/)). If you want to find other Google localizations, just Google whatever country you want to search from and &#8220;Google&#8221; and it will probably be the first result.
