**Times-News report sends developers, consultants, city counselors scrambling.** [Sunday Jared Hopkins story](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/07/20/news/top_story/140711.txt) revealed that a four-block downtown revitalization project planned to ask for $10 million in public funds to help developers. Tuesday story revealed the concomitant squirming of public officials who backed away from a consulting contract citing &#8220;unbalanced reporting&#8221; without giving examples. Hopkins, [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/07/22/news/local_state/140801.txt).
