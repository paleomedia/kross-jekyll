Education writer Jonathan Kozol who has been in classrooms across the country documenting the way that the No Child Left Behind Act has changed the way we teach recently ended a months long partial fast against the top down focus on testing regimes at the expense of inputs, like school funding. And six Idaho teachers were supporting his fast according to the [Idaho Education Association](http://www.idahoea.org/content/view/119/822/).
