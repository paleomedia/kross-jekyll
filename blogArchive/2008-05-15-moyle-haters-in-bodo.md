**BoDo developer Mark Rivers convinced former Eagle Mayor Nancy Merrill to take on Rep. Mike Moyle.** District 14 write-in campaign has deep backers. Merrill: &#8220;Why not go for the guy I believe is causing the most trouble?&#8221; Moyle pissed: &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of the way she&#8217;s been all along: kind of back and forth and wishy-washy.&#8221; He gave away campaign contribs thinking he was off the hook. Not-in-the-district-Rivers: &#8220;We have a logjam in the state Legislature and state government that&#8217;s caused by do-nothing legislators and flat-earth policies. This is not 1958 anymore.&#8221; Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/localnews/story/381844.html).
