The Idaho Senate Wednesday morning gave the nod to private contractors working on the state&#8217;s largest building project ever to use as much out-of-state labor as they like. The bill, [House bill 445](http://www3.state.id.us/oasis/H0445.html), exempts the restoration of the Statehouse from Title 44, Chapter 10 of Idaho code, a section that requires state building projects to use 95% bona fide Idaho workers.

You can [listen to the minimal debate on the Senate floor](http://www.paleomedia.org/audio/title44.m4a) set to a fitting Billie Holiday tune on PaleoMedia.org.

The bill now goes to the governor&#8217;s office for a signature. Gov. C.L. &#8220;Butch&#8221; Otter did oppose the Capitol renovation for a bit, but it&#8217;s expected he&#8217;ll sign the bill so the project can be expedited. An Otter spokesman declined comment on the bill Wednesday.
