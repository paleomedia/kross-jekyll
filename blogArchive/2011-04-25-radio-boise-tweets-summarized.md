For a few weeks now I&#8217;ve been intermittently tweeting about [Radio Boise](http://mainsite.radioboise.org/) (and not blogging at all). Here is a collection of tweets in time order using [Storify](http://storify.com/paleomedia) to organize them.

I went to the official ribbon cutting ceremony last week and was surprised at how excited I really was. I&#8217;ve always been on board with the idea of community radio in Boise and I remember going to the very first meeting some eight years ago when it all started. But I also kept a little distance from the effort, at first not thinking I had much to offer, then not sure if it was for real or not, and most recently trying to remain objective as a journalist covering the story (someone actually asked me if I was there to cover the ribbon cutting and I was thrilled to reply that no, I&#8217;m just there because I love the idea).

But now that it&#8217;s on the air and a new voice in the Idaho media landscape, I&#8217;m embracing the station fully. I grew up listening to Morgan State University&#8217;s community radio programming and fell in love with Caribbean music from a young age. Here&#8217;s to a generation of Boise kids growing up with a new universe of music and ideas and culture. Much respect to Jeff Abrams and the entire Radio Boise crew for pulling this off.
