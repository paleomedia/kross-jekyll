The Times-News had a decent weekend story about rapid growth in online charter schools in Idaho&#8230; and the fact that the State Department of Education does not know how the schools utilize a large portion of their funding.

The big papers all had legislative wrap-ups over the weekend&#8230; most imply that the session was not very productive. 

Lots of Lenore Barrett quotes, Lewiston Trib does an expose on judicial races and Clintobama in Montana in today&#8217;s Newsrack&#8230;

**Legislative session wraps**. Do nothing? Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/341285.html). Tale of two sessions: pre and post tax receipt downturn. AP in the [Press Tribune](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=7396). Missed opportunities at [Idaho Reports](http://idahoptv.org/idreports/)&#8230;

**Otter on legislators:** &#8220;We talk a lot, but we don&#8217;t communicate very much.&#8221; LiCalzi: &#8220;**It was like a perfect storm** â€“ everything seemed to go wrong.&#8221;Russell in the [Spokesman Review](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/idaho/story.asp?ID=239241&page=all). N. Idaho delegation on hits and misses. Ferguson in the [LMT](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/17317/) [subscrip]. $36 million short at the end of Jan. Phil Davidson in the [Post-Register](http://www.postregister.com/story.php?accnum=1002-04062008&today=2008-04-06%2000:00:00) [subscrip].

**Education Department not tracking funds to virtual schools.** $4.58 million of the money sent to four online public schools intentionally unaccounted for. SDE spokesperson: &#8220;We do not compare online charter schools to traditional schools or charter schools to traditional schools, etc., because every school is different.&#8221; Andrea Jackson in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/04/06/news/top_story/134306.txt).

**Canyon County considering alternatives to emissions testing.** Fuel efficient county vehicles, vapor traps, smog dogs, etc. DEQ: &#8220;You can&#8217;t bank on voluntary programs.&#8221; Barker in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/344217.html). 

**Far East Idaho divided over Teton Dam.** Legislature approved funds for a study to rebuild the dam. Locals remember its catastrophic failure. Jeanette Boner in the [Teton Valley News.](http://www.tetonvalleynews.net/articles/2008/04/03/news/news01.txt)

**Lenore Barrett writes.** Challis lawmaker&#8217;s legislative wrap-up focuses on&#8230; taxes. &#8220;Every Tom, Dick and Harry on the planet feels &#8220;entitled&#8221; to the sweat of another man&#8217;s brow. The legislature, struggling to fund necessities, had no problem voting a $3 million dollar donation to the Special Olympics. That is not the proper role of government, and is only one of many spending excesses.&#8221; Column in the [Island Park News](http://www.islandparknews.com/full.php?sid=4206) [free registration].

**Popkey: Otter is patient.** Gov. is not solely to blame for transportation funding gridlock. Sen. Brad Little: &#8220;There were representations from both chambers that, yeah, we&#8217;re going to do this. We were all saying transportation was on our going-home list. But then the House said, we just don&#8217;t have the votes. And the Senate said, well, let&#8217;s wait till next year. And that was it. All three of us could have handled it better.&#8221; Popkey in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/344235.html).

**NewWest has a mess of Clinton/Obama news out of Montana**, where both candidates were over the weekend. Missoula Mayor on Obama: &#8220;He could be a Missoulian.&#8221; Clinton: &#8220;Who said there aren&#8217;t a lot of Democrats in Montana?&#8221; [Wrap](http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/in_montana_obama_clinton_give_stage_for_western_issues/C37/L37/) by Matthew Frank and more [here](http://www.newwest.net/politics/).

**Headline: Battle for the Bench.** Of 42 district judges only six ran for office. Rest are political appointees. John Bradbury for State Supremes: &#8220;When you have a system and a culture that circumvents the entire electoral process for the judiciary how can (judges) be credible?&#8221; Joel Horton, incumbent: &#8220;I deal with a lot of folks &#8211; and not just lawyers and I&#8217;ve never heard anyone express to me a belief that judges are out of touch simply because they don&#8217;t frequently face contested elections.&#8221; Hedberg in the [LMT](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/17336/) [subscrip]. **Judicial ballot**: [lists incumbent twice](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/17335/).

**Rammell makes religious pitch.** Senate candidate says Lt. Gov. Risch pandering to Mormon voters. Risch: &#8220;Those comments don&#8217;t rise to the level of deserving a response.&#8221; Davidson in the [Post-Register](http://www.postregister.com/story.php?accnum=1052-04042008&today=2008-04-04&keywords=davidson).

**Related: Mormon Church to meet with gay LDS group.** Group: &#8221;Affirmation has tried 5 or 6 times over the past 31 years to meet with church leaders. This is their second response.&#8221; AP in the newly redesigned [Idaho State Journal](http://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/news02.txt).

**Kuna grows by 50 percent.** City annexes land to the south at behest of developer. in the Kuna Melba News. Scott McIntosh, [Kuna-Melba News](http://www.kunamelba.com/default.asp?sourceid=&smenu=84&twindow=&mad=&sdetail=484&wpage=1&skeyword=&sidate=&ccat=&ccatm=&restate=&restatus=&reoption=&retype=&repmin=&repmax=&rebed=&rebath=&subname=&pform=&sc=2008&hn=kunamelba&he=.com).

**Wolf shot in Wyo. had a name.** Well, a number at least. 253 had gone as far as Utah and was returned to Wyoming. Was known to Yellowstone wolf watchers. Kauffmann in the [Mtn. Express](http://www.mtexpress.com/index2.php?ID=2005120112).

**More gems from Barrett:** &#8220;Government wants to dictate your diet, filet your fat and send you to college whether you&#8217;re college material or not&#8221; and channelling Mother Goose: &#8220;There was an old woman who lived in a shoe. She had so many children she didn&#8217;t know what to do; so, she fed them some broth without any bread, spanked them all soundly and sent them to bed!&#8221;
