Boise cricketer Girish Cherussery, on a recent visit to Chennai, India to get married, told the regional daily about his efforts to establish cricket in the City of Trees.

We wrote about the Boise Cricket Club a few months back in the [Boise Weekly](http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=309880). The team expects to break ground soon on their new pitch in Ann Morrison Park.

[Mathrubhumi](http://mathrubhumi.info/static/about/about.htm), one of the oldest Indian nationalist papers ran a story about Cherussery and cricket in Boise. Also interviewed was Greg Moran, who was in Chennai to attend his teammate&#8217;s wedding ceremony.

The article is in Malayalam, and Cherussery is working on a translation for the team. If anyone knows the language feel free to leave comments below on what the article actually says.
