**Statesman reporters Druzin and Barker continue to make a case for letting more fires burn.** It&#8217;s a strong series on fire&#8230; Maybe Sunday will bring some answers: What&#8217;s the hold up in Congress on fire fighting policy? Today: how much it costs to fight fires (a ton) vs. how much benefit (little). &#8220;Suppression spending has jumped by a factor of more than six in just a decade, while community assistance spending has dropped by a third since 2001.&#8221; Libertarian enviro guy: &#8220;They&#8217;re definitely going in the wrong direction by providing more funds for suppression.&#8221; [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/localnews/story/449460.html).
