**CDA instance of Gov. Otter roadshow**: &#8220;More than 2,200 miles of pavement and 343 bridges have been deemed insufficient by the ITD.&#8221; Suggesting fuel tax hike of a penny, maybe, or registration hike of $10 to get at $240 million shortfall. Ryan Shelton, [CDA Press](http://www.cdapress.com/articles/2008/07/17/news/news01.txt). Otter and ITD are taking their show across Idaho, except [not exactly in Boise](http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A315567).
