**Randy Stapilus** at Ridenbaugh Press has [winnowed out](http://www.ridenbaugh.com/index.php/2008/05/15/id-primaries-to-legislate-by/) our earlier list of 10 key primary races across the state. Since we [picked our primaries](http://www.paleomedia.org/2008/04/14/paleomediaorg’s-hot-10-primary-races/) last month some of the field has changed.

Stapilus leads with the new race between former Eagle Mayor Nancy Merrill and Rep. Mike Moyle. But he does not give Merrill&#8217;s write-in campaign much cred. He also likes the Keough race in far North Idaho saying water adjudication has caused consternation in the district giving challenger Don Heckel a significant platform.

And Stapilus picks both House races in far East Idaho, including the open seat vacated by Larry Bradford. We agree that this grab-bag district is getting interesting.

One minor clarification to both our lists though: Kulczyk [has dropped out](http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:giy4Ddd3-1sJ:www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/368449.html+kulczyk+drops+out&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=safari) of the popular District 14 race.
