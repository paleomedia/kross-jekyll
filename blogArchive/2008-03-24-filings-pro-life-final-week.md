Confusion reigns over changes to state retiree medical bennies with a defenders of the bill going on the offensive over the weekend. The bill has yet to pass the House. 

But it is still road funding that is holding the session up. Meetings this morning are aimed at breaking the impasse. That, coupled with an interesting primary season now underway, has speculators speculating that this is the last week for the folks in Boise. 

PaleoMedia&#8217;s Hoffman is now a [Mad Voter](http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/obamas_race_in_the_west/C37/L37/), Pro-Life (the dude, not the position) gets more press and loose ends in today&#8217;s Newsrack&#8230;

* * *

**Pro-Life, formerly known as&#8230; bill introduced.** Ysursa wants a qualifier after Pro-Life&#8217;s name on the ballot. Senate likes it, rushes bill to the floor. Russell in the [Spokesman](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/breaking/story.asp?ID=14256).

**Ballot crowded with Pro-Life Richardson, a real Californian, others.** 13 file for Craig&#8217;s empty seat. Russell in the [Spokesman](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/idaho/story.asp?ID=237175).

**Coiner [bill](http://www3.idaho.gov/oasis/S1447.html) drops state coverage for 3,000 retirees.** Caps subsidy for others. Lawmakers say it&#8217;s not a bad deal. Worker advocates want more time to digest it. Ferguson in the [LMT](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/16691/) [subscrip]. **Coiner**: &#8220;Where are we slashing their health care benefits?&#8221; Lamay in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/330653.html).

**Good list of loose ends.** Legislature wants to go home midweek, but Statesman has a list of unfinished business. Mostly road funding, but lots of stuff stuck in committees too. Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/331288.html). **Grocery tax was an accomplishment.** Says Legislature. Otter has yet to sign. Another to-do list. Butts in the [Press Tribune](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=5647). **Sen. Davis&#8217; going home list.** Hopkins in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/03/23/news/local_state/133363.txt).

**Rep. Smith says no to local option Constitutional amendment.** Leon Smith: &#8220;As an ex-mayor, I always have cared for cities and local government. I don&#8217;t consider the Legislature omnipotent nor do I think we today will have more wisdom than the Legislature tomorrow. We&#8217;ve got plenty of needs now and we will in the future for local option taxes.&#8221; Nearly party line vote in House. Hopkins in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/03/22/news/local_state/133321.txt). But now how they want it. Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/330633.html).

**Rural Idaho population grows.** New Census figures show 20 of 38 sparse counties grew last year. Carlson in the [IBR](http://www.idahobusiness.net/archive.htm/2008/03/24/Population-growth-continues-in-rural-Idaho-counties).

**Hoffman on Obama and Race**. We are now [Mad Voters](http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/obamas_race_in_the_west/C37/L37/). Not sure if we are angry or certifiable, but we&#8217;re mad.

**The Annex mail room.** On [Boise State Radio](http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/idaho/news.newsmain?action=article&ARTICLE_ID=1249025&sectionID=1). Transporation equation on [IPTV](http://idahoptv.org/idreports/).

**Utah Legislature delays action on nondiscrimination measure too.** Forms interim committee for more study. PaleoMedia in SLC reads up on Rep. Christine Johnson&#8217;s LGBT nondiscrimination bill: “I consider it a little bit of a victory because they didn’t kill the bill on the spot. It’s very impressive that we are continuing the dialogue.” the Eric S. Peterson in the [Salt Lake Weekly](http://www.slweekly.com/index.cfm?do=article.details&id=C7F55A51-14D1-13A2-9F7677980BC860D0). **Boise gathering** on [S 1323](http://www3.idaho.gov/oasis/S1323.html) Wednesday, 12:30, Southside of the Annex.
