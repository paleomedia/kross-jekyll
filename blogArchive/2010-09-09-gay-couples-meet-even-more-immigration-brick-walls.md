An LGBT news site in Dallas is covering the story of [a gay couple forced to live apart](http://www.dallasvoice.com/couple-separated-immigration-laws-battles-terminal-cancer-congressman-refuses-intervene-1042578.html) for several apparently egregious reasons, starting with a now-rescinded ban on HIV-positive immigrants and even visitors to the United States. Aurelio Tolentino, originally from the Philipenes, was denied a green card based on his HIV status, according to the paper. He feared returning to the Philipenes and relocated to Canada where his mother lives. His partner, Roi Whaley, of Gulfport, Miss., is battling cancer and seeking treatment in Seattle. Whaley appealed to his congressman, Rep. Gene Taylor, a Democrat from Bay St. Louis, Miss., for help and was at first rebuffed. The website is reporting now that [Taylor may get involved](http://www.dallasvoice.com/progress-roi-aurelio-congressmans-office-reaches-gay-couple-separated-immigration-law-1042827.html/comment-page-1).
