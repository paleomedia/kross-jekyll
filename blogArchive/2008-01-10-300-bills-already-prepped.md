On the first day of the session there were 312 pieces of Legislation prepared for Idaho lawmakers&#8217; consideration. This is about average&#8230; there were 279 pre-bills last year and 350 the year before. The problem is these future bills are not public record until they are introduced, even though state workers spend time pouring over them. So the public does not know who (which lobbyists) have submitted the bills&#8230;
