Gov. Otter is back in the office meeting with Legislative leaders in person and holding a bill signing today at noon. To make dog fights a felony. 

Hearings coming this week on pre-schooling, maybe a vote on midwife licensing in the House and a raft of special interest liquor bills are coming down the pike.

**Affording to be a law maker.** Idaho legislators need to be able to afford to get away from their day jobs for three months. Per diem blank checks: &#8220;What they call per diem, it&#8217;s almost just like salaries because they don&#8217;t have to put in any receipts,&#8221; said Jasper LiCalzi, a College of Idaho professor of political economy. &#8220;Some say, &#8216;We want to run government like a business&#8217; but no business runs a business without receipts&#8230; The other side of that is how many people do you want to be looking at receipts?&#8221; Power lunches too.

Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/305208.html).

**Local labor rule likely to be repealed.** Just for Capitol project. Bill to exempt it from Idaho First law clears Senate committee on party-line vote, heads to full Senate. Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/303510.html).

**Legislature considering digital repository for state documents.** Kempthorne Admin Web site was gone the day he left. Can&#8217;t access his old press releases. Bill would help preserve official documents. Russell in the [Spokesman](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/idaho/story.asp?ID=233310&page=all).

**Airport has spent $17,000 prosecuting Craig.** New brief asserts that Sen. Larry Craig did conduct himself disorderly: &#8220;Rather than reveling in his own privacy within his closed stall, he decided to penetrate the adjacent closed stall through multiple furtive movements of his eyes, feet and hands&#8230; It is this very calling of attention to himself and failing to remain within his closed stall that is the basis for the charges and the appellant&#8217;s plea.&#8221; Bolstad in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/303517.html). **Craig cheered in Burley.** Craig presented with painting says it&#8217;s just on loan until he leaves office: “We’re going to remain ethically correct for the remaining nine months.&#8221; Greene, [South Idaho Press](http://www.southidahopress.com/articles/2008/02/23/news/local/9651craig.txt).
