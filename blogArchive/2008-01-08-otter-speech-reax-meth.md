For a minute there he looked like Al Gore, double Power Point screens, talking about hybrid vehicles for state agencies and a DEQ review of emissions. But no. State of the State at BSU felt like a college (high school?) graduation. But with quite a bit more politics thrown in. Nothing shocking in the speech, and the stuff he left out is very strategic&#8230; Luna&#8217;s teacher pay plan, transit for the Treasure Valley. There is the stuff he said, the stuff he didn&#8217;t say and the stuff he didn&#8217;t NOT say. Also, a health info sharing system for the state and the meth project in today&#8217;s Newsrack. [Please refresh this morning&#8230; more will be posted].<!--more-->
