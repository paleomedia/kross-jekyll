**Gay Pride float in Twin Falls Western Days parade can&#8217;t be too gay.** The Southern Idaho Gay Lesbian Bisexual and Transgender Community Center has to call itself the Community Center, nix rainbows, no AIDS education pamphlets. Parade chairwoman Lisa Cuellar: &#8220;No rainbows, no gay pride, not anything like that.&#8221; Wells Fargo can still have their little &#8220;Conestoga Wagon&#8221;, though. And the churches can have their thick, hairy crosses and happy faces. Hopkins in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/05/29/news/top_story/137679.txt).
