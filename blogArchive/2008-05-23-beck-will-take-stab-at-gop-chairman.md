**Rod Beck will challenge Idaho GOP chairman Kirk Sullivan at the party convention in June.** Boise water lobbyist and former U.S. House candidate Norm Semanko had considered a run but will only stand for election if Sullivan is doomed. Beck: &#8220;I was more than happy to support Norm Semanko. But if he&#8217;s not a candidate, I&#8217;m going to make sure there is a candidate in opposition. We&#8217;re going to have a vote, and I expect to win.&#8221; Miller, AP in [The Olympian](http://www.theolympian.com/northwest/story/457157.html).
