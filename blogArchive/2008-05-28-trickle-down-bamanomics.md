**Boise Weekly on Montana and the trickle down ticket.** Idaho GOP campaigner Jason Lehosit: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think having Clinton or Obama is going to take a solidly Republican district and make it Democrat.&#8221; AZ Gov. Napolitano: &#8220;The Democrats who are being elected in the West share a number of things: they&#8217;re very pragmatic, they talk to a large number of people, they&#8217;re interested in results and they&#8217;re interested in good government.&#8221; Rick Johnson, ICL, on Dems: &#8220;If they want to look at the West as the new South, they&#8217;d better start talking to it.&#8221; Andersen, [Boise Weekly](http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A314204).
