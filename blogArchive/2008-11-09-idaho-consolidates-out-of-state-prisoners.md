**Idaho Department of Corrections has ended its relationship with a Texas prison, moving all out-of-state inmates to private lock-up in Okla.** Prisoners to be moved from troubled Bill Clayton Detention Center, a private prison run by Geo Group in Littlefield, Texas. IDOC spokesperson: &#8220;Concern with staffing shortages at the (Bill Clayton) facility also factored into the decision.&#8221; Laurie WIlliams, brother of deceased inmate: &#8220;I&#8217;m happy they&#8217;re pulling them out of Texas. But I still have great concern about how we&#8217;re moving them from one profit-for-prison to another.&#8221; Andrea Jackson in the[Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/11/08/news/local_state/148327.txt).
