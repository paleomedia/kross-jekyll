**Dems say Senate candidate Jim Risch failed to claim campaign expenses for own office rental.** Risch spokesman says it&#8217;s preposterous. Manager Ryan White: &#8220;Office expenses were clearly reported on pages 201, 203, (and) 246 of the second quarter report.&#8221; Staff at [Press-Tribune](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=12287). Campaign pays $2,500 per month to Risch law firm for office space. [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/244/story/462253.html) staff.
