**According to a San Francisco Guardian story, via NewWest.net, some nuke waste from SF may be slated for an Idaho dump.** Hunter&#8217;s Point Shipyard hosts artists colony now found to be radiologically contaminated. SFBG: &#8220;Currently the Navy is proposing to excavate soil from IR-07 and IR-18, including known mercury and methane spots, and ship it to dumps in Idaho and Utah; fill and seal the suspect discharge channel; cover potentially radiologically impacted soil; and stipulate that these two areas be used as open space in future plans for the base.&#8221; Sharon Fischer on [NewWest.net](http://www.newwest.net/city/article/idaho_slated_to_be_navy_dumping_ground/C108/L108/) caught this [Bay Guardian story](http://www.sfbg.com/entry.php?entry_id=6746&catid=&volume_id=317&issue_id=387&volume_num=40&issue_num=42).
