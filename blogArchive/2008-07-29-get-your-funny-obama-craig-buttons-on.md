**LMT editor emeritus scored 10 copies of the Obama-Craig/LaRocco buttons that he has made famous.** Bill Hall: Like finding a damaged coin. Stuck to your shoe? LMT story via [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/453127.html). Button maker is funny: &#8220;This particular designer uses a fairly wide pointer arrow, which may have been in contact with a photo of Larry Craig.&#8221; With visual aid.
