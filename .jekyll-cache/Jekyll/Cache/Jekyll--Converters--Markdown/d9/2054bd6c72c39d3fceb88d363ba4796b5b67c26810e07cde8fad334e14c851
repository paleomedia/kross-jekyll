I"Œ<p>Idaho reached a deal with the Federal Government to remove some of the ‚Äútransuranic‚Äù waste buried at the National Lab after 35 years. Heralded by Gov. Otter and former Govs. Batt and Andrus, the deal is going to take another 20 years to implement. Poppino and Cooper in the <a href="http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/07/02/news/local_state/139671.txt">Times-News</a> lead with the fact that the state caved on demands to remove ALL of this particular type of waste, agreeing that it made sense to only remove some of it. John Miller at the <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/430579.html">AP</a> nailed down the the high cost of digging up the stuff and shipping it to Carlsbad.</p>
