I"‚<p><strong>Another 14 newspaper layoffs announced, this time at the Times-News in Twin Falls.</strong> Consolidation, usually a dirty word in newspapers, will allow 14 layoffs between the Times-News and the South Idaho Press and a series of community weeklies in the ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù Valley. This comes on the heals of layoffs at the Idaho Press-Tribune last week as well. Staff at <a href="http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/08/02/news/local_state/141562.txt">Times-News</a>.</p>
