I"­<p><strong>Idaho shells out $450,000 to state the obvious:</strong> roads need more care. Senate transportation chairman John McGee: â€œIt reiterates what the governorâ€™s been saying for the last two years-our roads are falling apart â€¦ You pay a little bit now, or you pay a heck of a lot later.â€ ITD does not even know what it needs to maintain. But the study may bear fruit: JoAn Wood: â€œI thought it was very well done â€“ it was exactly what we wanted. We were so concerned last year that we were not able to get the information we felt like we needed. We couldnâ€™t justify to our public any increase where it was not clearly beneficial to the whole state.â€ Russell at <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2009/jan/19/audit-says-idaho-needs-improve-road-maintenance/">Spokesman.com</a>.</p>

<p>But Wood, who runs the House Transportation Committee, <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/ID_TRANSPORTATION_AUDIT_IDOL-?SITE=IDLEW&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">told the AP</a> she wants to see changes in the department before it gets new funding.
