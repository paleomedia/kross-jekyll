<p>The Idaho Legislature <strong>changed the definition of hazardous waste</strong> in â€™01 for US Ecology according to the <a href="http://mountaingoatreport.typepad.com/the_mountaingoat_report/2008/05/the-idaho-state.html">MountainGoat Report</a>. The company returned to the Capitol in â€™02 and â€™04 winning reduced fees both times. Retired Boise Sen. Cecil Ingram was the only vote against the original bill.</p>

<p><strong>MountainGoat</strong>: â€œAccording to the Statesman, â€˜company officials say the more money American Ecology makes, the more the state of Idaho benefits.â€™ With these numbers it seems the more money American Ecology makes, the more money American Ecology makes.â€</p>
