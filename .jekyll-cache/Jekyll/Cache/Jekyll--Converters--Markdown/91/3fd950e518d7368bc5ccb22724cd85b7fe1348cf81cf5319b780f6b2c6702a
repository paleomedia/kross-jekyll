<p>Otter spokesman Jon Hanian said the trade mission is slated for April 19-26 and will include stops in Mexico City, Monterrey and Culiacan.</p>

<p>According to an email from Hanian: ‚ÄúIn short, the purpose of the mission is to: Trade (sell) Idaho products and services in Mexico, establish new distribution partners for Idaho companies in Mexico, identify Foreign Direct Investment Opportunities (FDI) for Mexican companies in Idaho.‚Äù</p>

<p>Otter has been home sick since Tuesday, according to his staff. He has made no no public statements since the Legislature adjourned Wednesday, aside from a brief, official message to lawmakers bidding them adios. Hanian told PaleoMedia.org on Thursday that Otter has been sick to his stomach.</p>

<p>Otter has scheduled a press conference for Monday morning.</p>

<p>Otter leaves for Mexico on April 19 and is scheduled to return April 26. Last year, soon after the Legislative session adjourned, Otter took a <a href="http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A219288">trade mission to Cuba</a> that yielded little in the way of new exports.</p>

<p>Idaho‚Äôs <a href="http://trade.idaho.gov/Portals/19/documents/Mexico%202006.pdf">largest export item to Mexico</a>, as of 2006, was potato flour, at $32.9 million. Total exports to Mexico in 2006 were $128.2 million.</p>
