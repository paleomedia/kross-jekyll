Today: how much it costs to fight fires (a ton) vs. how much benefit (little). â€œSuppression spending has jumped by a factor of more than six in just a decade, while community assistance spending has dropped by a third since 2001.â€ Libertarian enviro guy: â€œTheyâ€™re definitely going in the wrong direction by providing more funds for suppression.â€ <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/localnews/story/449460.html">Statesman</a>.</p>
