<p>I decided not to lug my laptop to Mexico for this reporting trip. Instead I´m working with my iPod Touch (4th Generation) and an external bluetooth keyboard.</p>

<p>It´s worked really well so far. I upgraded my iPod before I left so that I could make use of the on-board microphone and the bluetooth support that the newest iPods have. I picked up a Microsoft Bluetooth Mobile Keyboard 6000 the night before I left because I like the key action better than the Apple keyboards, which must have been made for graphic designers who can´t speal anyway. And I use a cheap plastic stand for the ipod while I´m typing.</p>

<p>I am using the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plaintext-dropbox-text-editing/id391254385?mt=8">PlainText</a> app for typing up my notes every night and for drafting blog posts. I like the clean interface but wish I could figure out how to use bullets and maybe even embed hyperlinks. It also syncs with my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> account, which is where I access all of my notes for the book anyway. That is really convenient (when I have wi-fi).</p>

<p>I´m using the WordPress iPhone app to blog, mostly, but again, it seems to be lacking in its ability to handle photos and links and character styles like bold, etc. Maybe there is a better one out there? I´ve had to go online to fix a lot of issues with my posts. (Right now I´m using a PC at a public library somewhere in Mexico City … I´ll have to geotag the post to find out where I am, actually.)</p>

<p>It also seems like PlainText screws up the hard returns on my blog posts, but I have to experiment more with that.</p>

<p>The new iPod takes really nice little videos, but again, I have not had stable enough wi-fi anywhere to upload them. I am using HootSuite to post to Twitter and Facebook, Skype to call home and now TextFree to send free texts (otherwise they cost me at least 50 cents apiece). I am also using <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/spanishdict/id332510494?mt=8">SpanishDict</a>, which does not require wi-fi and has proven pretty thorough and even hip to the times.</p>

<p>Oh, and most important perhaps, I use <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/es/app/italk-recorder/id293673304?mt=8">iTalk light</a> to record interviews, though I might buy the full version when I get back.</p>

<p>I like the little plastic base for the iPod (from XtremeMac) but I think a sturdier one would help. There is alot of pushing on the screen even when I use the external keyboard. If I need to plug in, I just put the iPod upside down and work near an outlet.</p>

<p>There are only two problems: (1) A frequent lack of wi-fi and (2) the inability to transfer photos from my digital SLR camera to the iPod (computer). I toyed with the idea of using the <a href="http://www.eye.fi/">Eye-Fi memory card</a> in my camera, which can connect to wi-fi, but I could not figure out a good system before I left. I also found a card reader that fits in the iPod on Amazon.com before I left but I can´t find it again.</p>

<p>I know others are doing this type of thing, but it took me a long time to figure out all the peices in an economical way, so I thought this might help other reporters or travelers out there. Let me know if you have other suggestions or techniques.</p>
