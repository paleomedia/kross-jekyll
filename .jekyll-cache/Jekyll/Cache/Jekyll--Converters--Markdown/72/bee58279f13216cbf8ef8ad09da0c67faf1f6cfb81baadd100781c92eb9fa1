<p>The senators openly call U.S. policy toward Cuba one of isolation and estrangement. They bemoan the lack of opportunities for business, travel and democracy building in Cuba under U.S. policy. Still, Bush <a href="http://voanews.com/english/2008-02-28-voa37.cfm">says he will not meet with Raul Castro</a>.</p>

    <p>
      The Honorable Condoleeza Rice<br /> Secretary of State<br /> U.S. Department of State<br /> 2201 C Street NW<br /> Washington, DC 20520
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Dear Secretary Rice,
    </p>
    
    <p>
      On Tuesday, February 19, Fidel Castro resigned after serving as Cubaâ€™s leader for nearly 50 years. This welcome and historic event provides the United States with an important opportunity to reflect upon and reconsider U.S. policy toward Cuba.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our current policy of isolation and estrangement has failed. New laws that tightened sanctions in 1992 and 1996 have had no effect. The administration&#8217;s 2004 sanctions and its comprehensive plan to bring about transition in Cuba have failed in their objective. The absence of Fidel Castro for 20 months has not led to a change in the system.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Instead, our current policy deprives the United States of influence in Cuba, including the opportunity to promote principles that advance democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. By restricting the ability of Americans to travel freely to Cuba, we limit contact and communication on the part of families, civil society, and government. Likewise, by restricting the ability of our farmers, ranchers, and businesses to trade with Cuba, the United States has made itself irrelevant in Cubaâ€™s growing economy, allowing Cuba to build economic partnerships elsewhere.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There is no magic U.S. policy that will transform Cuba. But with Cuba facing a period of change, we have a new opportunity to seize. Our policy based on sanctions, passivity, and waiting should end. We need a new approach that defends human rights, is confident about the value of American engagement with Cubans, builds new economic bridges between America and Cuba, and seeks every possible avenue of increasing American influence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We urge you to take a fresh look at our policy toward Cuba. We should seize upon Castroâ€™s long-awaited and welcome departure to chart a new course that favors hope and engagement over isolation and estrangement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Respectfully,
    </p>
    
    <p>
