I"…<p>Idaho Sen. Larry Craig recently revealed that he plans to write a book about the nationâ€™s energy future after he leaves the Senate at the end of his term, according to a small-town newspaper.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.paleomedia.org/wp-content/themes/tma/images/latest/craigshot.jpg" alt="Craig on his Web site" class="alignleft" /> Craig was in American Falls, Idaho recently talking fertilizer and PR with backers of a proposed coal-gassification plant. After a detailed discussion on emissions, energy credits and the public perceptions of CO2, Craig revealed that he intends to write a book on Americaâ€™s energy future when he leaves the Senate.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.press-times.com/Press%204-2-08/senator.html">Power County Press</a> had the story a week and a half ago.</p>

<p>Craig told plant supporters that they need to keep pitching the public on their idea.</p>

<p>â€œOften times, we get so interested in the work at hand that we forget the PR side,â€ Craig said, according to the paper. â€œWe need to be sensitive to PR because it does shape public opinion.â€</p>

<p>Craig, who was arrested last year at the Minneapolis Airport during a menâ€™s bathroom sex sting and pled guilty to the charges, is not seeking another Senate term. He recently told The Hill, a D.C. newspaper, that his decision not to run again <a href="http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/craig-offers-support-to-vitter-2008-04-08.html">predated the sex scandal</a>.</p>

<p>Craig, no stranger to PR, has been fighting to have his guilty plea reversed.</p>

<p>Craig has worked closely with nuclear, oil and gas companies during his long tenure in the Senate.</p>
