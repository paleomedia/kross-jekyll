I"Ý<p>Iâ€™m doing some reading on the open data movement for a new project that we will announce in a few weeks and came across anÂ interesting history ofÂ the human genome project. Iâ€™m looking at links between the open data movement, which is mostly concerned with public, government information and its release in free, usable, digital formats, and open data in academia â€” university research data â€” which is often treated as private or somehow protected information.</p>
