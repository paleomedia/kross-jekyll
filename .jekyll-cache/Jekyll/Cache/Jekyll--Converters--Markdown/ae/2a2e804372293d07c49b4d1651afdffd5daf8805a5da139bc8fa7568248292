I"[<p><strong>Congressional candidate Walt Minnick offered discounted gas to Boise drivers for about an hour Tuesday to highlight Rep. Bill Sali’s ties to oil and gas companies.</strong> Idaho GOP, <a href="http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A313627">Boise Weekly</a> call it a stunt. Minnick: “Idahoans are being pummeled at the pump while their congressman is hobnobbing with the very people who are getting filthy rich from high gas prices.” Sali spokesman Wayne Hoffman: “Radical environmentalists like Walt Minnick are directly responsible for the environmental policies that have given us high gas prices.” Kuraitis on <a href="http://www.newwest.net/city/article/minnick_holds_cheap_gas_event/C108/L108/">NewWest.net</a>.
