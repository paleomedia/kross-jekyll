I"Æ<p>Glee at the debate over Election Day liquor sales pervaded the Capitol Press Corps Monday. Itâ€™s a wonder elections even get covered with this prohibition in place that looks like itâ€™s coming to an end.</p>

<p>The House is going to look at a few more tax exemptions this last week or two of the session, in part because theyâ€™ve approved so many more this session. Like a tax break to a company that may never even have offices here that passed the Senate yesterday.</p>

<p>State agencies getting just a bitty bit more cash, Story Corps coming to town and a local option retrospective in todayâ€™s Newrack.</p>
