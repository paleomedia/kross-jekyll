I"ž<p>This site has admittedly been pretty sporadic for a few months. Weâ€™ve been dealing with a new baby, a new job and trying to get in shape for elk season. So thanks to all the folks that keep checking back.</p>

<p>You may be interested in a new blog that is part of my day job. I call is citydesk (lower case please) and it is a mix of Boise, Boise Valley and state news that comes across our radar down at the Boise Weekly offices. You can <del datetime="2008-08-23T02:37:15+00:00">take a peak today</del>check it out <a href="http://citydesk.boiseweekly.com">here</a>, <del datetime="2008-08-23T02:37:15+00:00">but</del> set your bookmarks for citydesk.boiseweekly.comâ€¦</p>

<p>I am going to keep PaleoMedia.org going because I still think itâ€™s a good idea. But I encourage you to check back maybe once a week rather than every day. Maybe consider it like your Sunday paper, without the paperâ€¦ Weâ€™ll have lots more stuff on here during the legislative session of course and maybe some new features.</p>

<p>So stay in touch.</p>
