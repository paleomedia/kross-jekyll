<p>In his presentation to the Legislative budget committee Thursday, public schools chief Tom Luna made a new argument for including contract rights in his controversial teacher pay plan. In response to a question from Boise Sen. Elliot Werk, Luna said that iSTARS is not just a merit or pay for performance bonus plan. “This is about increasing teacher pay, that’s what iSTARS is about,” Luna said. Only one of the series of bonuses proposed is to reward student success, the rest are about where and what teachers teach, Luna added. None of the stories below picked up on the comment, but it’s interesting in light of Gov. Otter’s call for all of his proposed 5 percent pay hike to go to merit pay. Maybe it’s just mincing words though. Also, Rev and Tax does its thing, Fish and Game Commission meets and boat safety tossed overboard.</p>

<p><strong>Luna trims teacher bonus plan.</strong> Cuts bonuses by $200, revises estimate on number of teachers who will sign up. Budget committee had lots of questions. Dean Cameron: “How can an iSTARS approach, your approach, work with essentially about half of the amount of money that you deemed was necessary in order to implement it?” Allen in the <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/268338.html">Statesman</a>.

<p><strong>Corder threatens House Rev and Tax.</strong> Sen. Tim Corder: “(We’ll) make the point: Come and talk to us or things will stop.” House bills will die, that is, after House tax committee kills nearly all efforts to repeal tax exemptions.

Ken Roberts: “I’m not opposed to looking at tax exemptions. … I have a problem picking out a few. … If we’re going to do this, we oughta sunset all exemptions and have all of ’em come back in and make their case.” Russell in the <a href="http://www.spokesmanreview.com/idaho/story.asp?ID=228202">Spokesman</a>.

<p><strong>McGee feels good</strong>. She left $108,000 a year job at State Board of Education to work as a special assistant to the Governor for $60,000 but it has nothing to do with the bad $1.4 million check she wrote.

<p><strong>Quote of the Day</strong>: “Those people that believe in shooting animals through a fence after enticing them to the fence with a bucket of grain ought to turn the rifle around the other way.” Former Gov.

<p><strong>IDFG chief Groen writes to the world on wolves.</strong> “For Groen and his department managing wolves will be a balancing act.
