Bill Sali, just back from Iraq, said Iraqis recognize themselves as Iraqis.</strong> Sali: “Increasingly, they’re starting to recognize themselves more as Iraqis instead of sectarian designations that they’ve had in the past.” He also praised the surge and medical care for U.S. troops. Minnick praised surge too, and a timetable: “I find it interesting that the political leadership of both parties is coalescing around this view.” Bolstad in the <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/464696.html">Statesman</a>.</p>
