I"¾<p><strong>BoDo developer Mark Rivers convinced former Eagle Mayor Nancy Merrill to take on Rep. Mike Moyle.</strong> District 14 write-in campaign has deep backers. Merrill: â€œWhy not go for the guy I believe is causing the most trouble?â€ Moyle pissed: â€œItâ€™s kind of the way sheâ€™s been all along: kind of back and forth and wishy-washy.â€ He gave away campaign contribs thinking he was off the hook. Not-in-the-district-Rivers: â€œWe have a logjam in the state Legislature and state government thatâ€™s caused by do-nothing legislators and flat-earth policies. This is not 1958 anymore.â€ Druzin in the <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/localnews/story/381844.html">Statesman</a>.</p>
