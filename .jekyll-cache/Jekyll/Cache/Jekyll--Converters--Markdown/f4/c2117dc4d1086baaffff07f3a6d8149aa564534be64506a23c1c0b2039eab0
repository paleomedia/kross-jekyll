I"ı<p>I dug out my Egypt journal from 1998 when I spent about a five weeks traveling across the Sinai, to Cairo and up the Nile (which means south, into Africa). This was my first time really traveling. I was 20 years old.</p>

<p>I was hoping for some penetrating political analysis that might help me understand the current situation in Cairo, but thereâ€™s not much there. I did meet tons of young Egyptians with very modern, occasionally progressive, selectively informed views of the worldâ€”some of whom I imagine are now gathered on Tahrir Square. But I was not very aware of Egyptian politics at the time.</p>

<p>There are a couple of themes that jump out:</p>

<p><strong>1) I can never sleep</strong>: â€œI canâ€™t sleep cuz of the damn Bedu Teaâ€”thatâ€™s it!â€ (2/3/98)</p>

<p><strong>2) I have lots of digestive problems</strong> (in retrospect, these are probably, wheat/gluten related, but I did not know it at the time:</p>

<p>â€œI shat and burped all nite long + hardly slept. I had something really bad in my stomach â€“ I tried to sleep late but of course just lay there. So I took a cold shower, tried to shave, + made noodles that I couldnâ€™t even eat. I lay in pain reading Song of Myself for and hr. or so + drank a Pepsi. Then I went off to check e-mailâ€”oh shit. I was stumblingâ€”my head is lightâ€¦ â€ (2/4/98)</p>

<p>â€œDo they really drink Nile water here?? I think soâ€¦â€ (2/26/98)</p>

<p>â€œSo I slept crappy in Mohammedâ€™s crappy village. Shat bad thrice. This morn. really bad. All water every 20 min. I wanted to hurl. We had to ride a truck into Edfu â€” 1 LE â€” I was w/ 4 tourists now. Needed a shitter in Edfu â€“ but no one helped me so I hurled in a coffee shopâ€” a lot of Muhammedâ€™s crappy sahleb did come up. And other undigested food. Perhaps the culprit. I then led the tourists to the temple and we are waiting for Jeff to get his Pharonic pleasure. The back to Luxor + either to the Red Sea or Cairo. Weâ€™ll see.â€ (3/4/98)</p>

<p>**3) Iâ€™m still more obsessed with religion than politics:<br />
**<br />
â€œWe talked about Jews, Is. + america, religion, sex, money, anarchy and I explained evolution. One lawyer guy thought I was Is. and kind of freaked me out. There was an old security guard from the bank there who was very funny. Sephinaâ€”moch kabir. Then I drank helba w/ three guys but they murdered a rat so I left nauseous. Now I am trying to sleep. â€”INCHALLAH.â€ (Esna â€” 2/26/98)</p>

<p>â€œThen I met up w/ 4 college kids + a motherâ€”Fifi, Ibrahim, Mohammed, + Joseph. They were kinda young but we hung out for all afternoon. Went to a few mosquesâ€”I like a good mosque. Then I told them I was Jewish. They were shocked!! So was Gaza chick. And the boys I hung w/ last nite.â€ (Cairo 2/8/98)</p>

<p>â€œThen another â€œrichâ€ friend Mohammed showed up + the religious conversations started. I am kinda tired of this but feel it is my duty to spread doubt + fear thru-out the Muslim world. Every Muslim I have met uses the same â€œScientificâ€ proof for godâ€”the teleologic approach I thinkâ€”who made the sun, the Nile, yo mommaâ€”chicken + egg, and well at least no Jesus stuff. We talked for a long time. They thought I was a spy â€¦ Then Mohammed gave me a Great Cheese Bun + I went back to Jamaica + slept on the porch-er balcÃ³n. This morn I talked to my two stoner roomates a Coloradan lad who is probably going to get â€¦ [censored!]â€ (Palestine Club, Aswan 2/29/98)<br />
[<strong>CONTEXT</strong>: the â€œdoubt + fearâ€ I mention above is the absolutely intoxicating spasms of perplexity that an agnostic, pro-Arab Jewish American who speaks Arabic creates throughout the Muslim world, or at least did in 1998 (pre-GWOT)â€¦ nothing nefarious.]</p>

<p><strong>4) I think the most interesting <del datetime="2011-02-07T15:51:56+00:00">post</del> journal entry (beside my immature ponderings on women, tourism and food) is my experience visiting the town of <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/thread.jspa?threadID=1715292">Asyut</a></strong>, a long time fundamentalist stronghold that was under lockdown in 1998 by Egyptian police (army?) I hitchhiked there:</p>

<p>2/22/98 Al-Qasr â€”&gt;Asyut<br />
â€œSo I continued up the street and encountered two nice boys â€¦ from Farafra of course â€¦ we sat down + the younger one ran off-returning moments later w/ two heads of lettuce for me. So I broke out the peanuts. 1/2 hr. later a <em>big</em> truck pulled upâ€”I lashed my bag to the bed + Ahmad + his friend + I took off for Asyut!! Quais! He was a <em>very</em> nice man from Alexandria. We talked about the desert a lotâ€”he doesnâ€™t like the desert. At the rest stop they shat in the desert and then made tea w/ a big gas stove in the cab of the tractor trailer. They kept a tea pot, cups, sugar etc in the glove compartment. They dropped meâ€”for a head of lettuceâ€”7 km from Assyut, center of Islamic fundamentalism + terrorist activity. I walked a km. and then a small pickup stopped +took me into town. I met some local college boys + we walked over the bridge in search of coshariâ€”only to be stopped by the policeâ€”copious police you could sayâ€”they got rid of the college boys + took over. I watched as they searched targeted galibeyaâ€™d individuals from every minivan. 3 guys w/ guns felt â€™em up looking for a gun I guessâ€”checked ID worked em over. I wasnâ€™t quite sure why or why I was just standing there. Then the CAPTAIN came up + asked me about a hotel + made conversation. Of course leading to Iraq + US + well the inch-Allahing Sadaam wiping out Israel. w/ a hearty laugh + smile. I just swallowed â€¦ [censored] â€¦ I gave them my nus-nus Is/Pal bitâ€”then I jumped on a police transport w/ two armed guards + crossed the channel. I switched trucks + went to get coshari w/ an armed guard. I was really laughing now. Then I got a hotel room for 20 lbsâ€”not what I really wanted, but fineâ€”my own roomâ€”and Mr. Mamdough who likes dealing w/ Americans + wants to migrate. There are 3 police here guarding me. Thanks.â€</p>

<p>2/23/98 Jihad â€”&gt; Masr Qadimah<br />
â€œSlept fineâ€”survived at leastâ€”I waited around for my police escort this morning + we went outâ€”the 4 of us. I got some <em>good</em> falafel â€” 1.80 for a lot. Then we walked to the Nileâ€”checked it out. They wouldnâ€™t even let anyone talk to me or even come near â€” I bought some good hot bread. We let it cool on the street. There is a whole culture of letting fresh bread cool here. In factâ€”all of society may be based on the 15 min cooling period of bread. Then I bought the pigs teaâ€”went to get my bag + we all went to the train station. 13 LE to Luxorâ€”I think 2nd class. We waited in the train station cafeteria for 45 min. + then they â€œhelpedâ€ me on the train. Very strange â€¦ The train was pretty niceâ€”a lot of leg room. I read a littleâ€”looked out the windowâ€”the whole way was NICE farm land. I love the geometry of farm land I think. It is beautiful squares + diff. levels of tall sugarcane, dwarfing hashish, soldierly onion â€¦ and the occasional squatting fellahin changing all that geometry w/ a sickle.â€</p>
