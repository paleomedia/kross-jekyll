I"Ç<p><strong>G. Rustyn Casiano is running for the Legislature because â€œshe got mad.â€</strong> Mountain Home Democrat/retired Air Force medical corpsman will challenge Rep. Tim Corder or <a href="http://www.claytoncramer.com/weblog/2008_05_18_archive.html#8008751979942803857">Clayton Cramer</a>, if he is victorious in next weekâ€™s primary. Casiano likes balanced budgets, vouchers, charters, open meetings. Casiano: â€œIâ€™d like to see some open meetings. I think the public should see whatâ€™s going on before they pass the laws.. Itâ€™s all about access and taxes. I donâ€™t think people know whatâ€™s going on.â€ <a href="http://www.mountainhomenews.com/story/1402596.html">Mountain Home News</a>.</p>
