Otter roadshow</strong>: “More than 2,200 miles of pavement and 343 bridges have been deemed insufficient by the ITD.” Suggesting fuel tax hike of a penny, maybe, or registration hike of $10 to get at $240 million shortfall. Ryan Shelton, <a href="http://www.cdapress.com/articles/2008/07/17/news/news01.txt">CDA Press</a>. Otter and ITD are taking their show across Idaho, except <a href="http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A315567">not exactly in Boise</a>.</p>
