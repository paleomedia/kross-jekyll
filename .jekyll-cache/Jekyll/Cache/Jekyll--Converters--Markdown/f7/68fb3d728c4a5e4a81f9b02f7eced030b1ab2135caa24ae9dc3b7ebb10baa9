I"D<p>For a minute there he looked like Al Gore, double Power Point screens, talking about hybrid vehicles for state agencies and a DEQ review of emissions. But no. State of the State at BSU felt like a college (high school?) graduation. But with quite a bit more politics thrown in. Nothing shocking in the speech, and the stuff he left out is very strategic… Luna’s teacher pay plan, transit for the Treasure Valley. There is the stuff he said, the stuff he didn’t say and the stuff he didn’t NOT say. Also, a health info sharing system for the state and the meth project in today’s Newsrack. [Please refresh this morning… more will be posted].<!--more--></p>
