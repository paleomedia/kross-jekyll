I"Ô<p>Gov. Butch Otter began shopping his plan to begin immediate construction on a privately built and operated prison, but was met with some skepticism from Legislative leaders Wednesday. Funding for a new prison was not in Otterâ€™s budget, but the state would not have to pay immediately if a prison company was contracted for the work. There is a lengthy piece of legislation that would authorize the privately run prison, but it has not been introduced yet.</p>

<p>Also, House and Senate leaders questioned some of Otterâ€™s other spending at an Idaho Press Club luncheon, the annual raft of sex offender bills are getting heard and ACLU chief Jack Van Valkenburgh is moving on in todayâ€™s Daily Newsrack. [updates will be posted throughout the morning.]</p>
