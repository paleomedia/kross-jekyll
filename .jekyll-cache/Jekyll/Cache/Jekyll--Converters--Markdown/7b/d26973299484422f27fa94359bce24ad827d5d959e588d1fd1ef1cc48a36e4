I"u<p>The Idaho Senate Wednesday morning gave the nod to private contractors working on the state’s largest building project ever to use as much out-of-state labor as they like. The bill, <a href="http://www3.state.id.us/oasis/H0445.html">House bill 445</a>, exempts the restoration of the Statehouse from Title 44, Chapter 10 of Idaho code, a section that requires state building projects to use 95% bona fide Idaho workers.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.paleomedia.org/audio/title44.m4a">listen to the minimal debate on the Senate floor</a> set to a fitting Billie Holiday tune on PaleoMedia.org.</p>

<p>The bill now goes to the governor’s office for a signature. Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter did oppose the Capitol renovation for a bit, but it’s expected he’ll sign the bill so the project can be expedited. An Otter spokesman declined comment on the bill Wednesday.</p>
