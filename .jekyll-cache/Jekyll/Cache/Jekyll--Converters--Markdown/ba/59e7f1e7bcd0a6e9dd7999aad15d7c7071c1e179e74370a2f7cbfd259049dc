I"G<p><strong>Rep. Bill Sali is complaining to the ATF for more credit on pocket knife spat.</strong> Sali wants credit for stopping the Feds from buying inspirational Leathermen for agents. But ATF says it stopped the purchases well before Sali complained. Sali: “…these conflicting versions of the facts have not only damaged my credibility, but that of your office as well.” Bolstad in the <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/387273.html">Statesman</a>.
