I"ã<p>Boise cricketer Girish Cherussery, on a recent visit to Chennai, India to get married, told the regional daily about his efforts to establish cricket in the City of Trees.</p>

<p>We wrote about the Boise Cricket Club a few months back in the <a href="http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=309880">Boise Weekly</a>. The team expects to break ground soon on their new pitch in Ann Morrison Park.</p>

<p><a href="http://mathrubhumi.info/static/about/about.htm">Mathrubhumi</a>, one of the oldest Indian nationalist papers ran a story about Cherussery and cricket in Boise. Also interviewed was Greg Moran, who was in Chennai to attend his teammateâ€™s wedding ceremony.</p>

<p>The article is in Malayalam, and Cherussery is working on a translation for the team. If anyone knows the language feel free to leave comments below on what the article actually says.</p>
