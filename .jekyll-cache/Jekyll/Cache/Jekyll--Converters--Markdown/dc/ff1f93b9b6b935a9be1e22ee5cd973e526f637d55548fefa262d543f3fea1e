I"ê	<p>My first ‚Äúpeer reviewed‚Äù article is being published this week in <a href="http://www.boisestate.edu/research/pubs/landscape-series.asp">Idaho Landscapes</a>, a journal published by Boise State University‚Äôs Division of Research and College of Social Sciences and Public Affairs, along with the Idaho State Historical Society and Idaho State University. I wrote a history of Mexican music in the State of Idaho for this issue, an expansion on <a href="http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/durango-style-boise/Content?oid=1014539">a story I did for the Boise Weekly</a> in 2009. I put ‚Äúpeer reviewed‚Äù in quotes here, because in some ways newspaper articles are peer reviewed as well. But I was honored to be read by university historians and social scientists and to pass their academic smell test on this piece. And the story was very fun to revisit.</p>

<p>In fact, it starts far from Idaho, in rural Michoac√°n State in January, where I was visiting a man from Idaho who will be part of Amor and Exile. The band Banda Cuisillos was playing the weekend I was there, at the <a href="http://mexico.pueblosamerica.com/i/santa-gertrudis-38/">Santa Gertrudis</a> rodeo grounds. We didn‚Äôt go to the concert, but we stood outside the rodeo grounds and watched the scene for a long time and I was struck by the connections to the U.S. in general and to Idaho in particular that I found. I write about those deep connections in the Idaho Landscapes story.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs just one of those connections (note the venue in this video):</p>

<p>The magazine will be released on Thursday, May 5 at Boise State‚Äôs Center on the Main, 1020 Main St. (The Alaska Building). Doors open at 6 pm, program at 7 pm including Mariachi Tleyotltzin. I‚Äôll sign your copy ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>And here‚Äôs some really rad music I came across while reporting the story. This is music made in Idaho, mind you:</p>
