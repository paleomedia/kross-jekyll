I"#<p>For the past two years or so, I have been slowly learning to code, and I’m doing it for one main reason: There are systems out there that I want to help fix.</p>

<p>One of those systems is the Idaho state legislature’s web site: it bothers me that bill and legislator information is buried so deeply and difficult to find and lacking in useful detail, and so I am working on an <a href="https://github.com/paleomedia/idleg_flask">alt legislative website</a> that will make it easier to find and track Idaho (and maybe other state) legislative info.</p>

<p>I also recently got involved in a grassroots election results hack, <a href="http://openelections.net/">Open Elections</a>, that is attempting to standardize election result reporting across the country. I helped build <a href="http://latino208.com">Latino208.com</a>, and I’m working on civic-minded web projects in both of my day jobs, at Boise State and in the city’s IT department.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-1667 size-medium" src="http://www.paleomedia.org/wp-content/themes/tma/images/hackfort3-300x300.jpg" alt="Hackfort 3" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://www.paleomedia.org/wp-content/themes/tma/images/hackfort3-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.paleomedia.org/wp-content/themes/tma/images/hackfort3-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.paleomedia.org/wp-content/themes/tma/images/hackfort3-768x768.jpg 768w, http://www.paleomedia.org/wp-content/themes/tma/images/hackfort3-144x144.jpg 144w, http://www.paleomedia.org/wp-content/themes/tma/images/hackfort3.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Next week I’ll be working, on my own time, on an app for the Hackfort Hackathon, the civic tech track at the Treefort Music Fest in Boise. I volunteered for the civic track committee, and, full disclosure, I also helped pull together the <a href="http://opendata.cityofboise.org/datasets?keyword=hackfort">City of Boise’s Hackfort data offerings</a> that may aid in the hackathon.</p>

<p>[<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hackfortfest/events">Lots of Hackfort events on FB</a></strong>]</p>

<p>This year, Jimmy Hallyburton of Boise Bicycle Project put out a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackfort/comments/48oip1/bicycle_crash_report_stuffideasexample/">call for a bike crash reporting app</a>, which inspired the general topic of “hacking Boise transportation” for this year’s hackathon. The idea is to crowd source a database of otherwise unreported bike crashes in order to help identify the causes and location of bike-auto collisions and ideally to prevent them in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Inspired by a call to action from the Boise Bicycle Project, <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hackfort3&amp;src=typd">#Hackfort3</a> asks developers, designers and civic hackers to consider: What data and/or software do you need in your pocket in order to get around town better?</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really hope a team or several teams tackle this idea — it’s valuable data to collect, community driven, provides potentially life-saving information to cyclists as well as drivers, transportation planners, police officers and researchers and supports the mission of a kickass local nonprofit. Check the <a href="http://hackfort3.devpost.com/">Hackathon page at Dev Post</a> to find a team or start a new one.</p>

<p>Here’s nine ideas for apps, some based on available public data, for anyone to use (leave more ideas in the comments or at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackfort">reddit</a>):</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Boise Bicycle Crash Reporting app, mentioned above, of course.</li>
  <li>Skateboard route finder, with skater friendly paths, byways, stairs and bowls marked — perhaps a Google maps hack for skater routing?</li>
  <li>Better Boise Bus Finder: <a href="http://67.220.100.109:52025/portal/fr2/index.jsf">ValleyRide now has a bus geolocator</a>, but perhaps there is a better implementation of it out there?</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://boise.greenbike.com/">Boise GreenBike</a> dashboard that shows how people get around Boise by bike, as the Ada County Highway District considers more permanent bike lanes downtown and elsewhere (use the <a href="http://opendata.cityofboise.org/datasets/72a6c02bfc2e46a7b61d63218514905a_0">ACHD bike lane/route map</a> and the <a href="http://opendata.cityofboise.org/datasets/16cd2ee535fe4a48b286d63bd91b79b1_0">Boise GreenBike 2015 ride data</a> and <a href="http://boise.greenbike.com/opendata">realtime bike availability API</a>!) –&gt; See <a href="http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/datachallenge-2014">EXAMPLES</a></li>
  <li>Ridesharing, for real. Uber has already disrupted the taxi economy in Boise, but there may be a market for legit ride sharing (maybe not?) based on workplaces, recreation venues (Bogus?), etc. (Think <a href="http://achd.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Viewer/index.html?appid=448803740de84626873220c640b50984">Park &amp; Ride</a> meets Uber…)</li>
  <li>Tours: Lots of tour ideas, depending on your fancy, but last year the <a href="http://datefort.boiseopenapps.org">winning Hackfort team made a random date generator</a>. This year, you could help people get to their dates: directions between <a href="http://opendata.cityofboise.org/datasets?keyword=recreation">park amenities</a>, add <a href="http://opendata.cityofboise.org/datasets/c07e4f4b146a48edbee5385750a46aba_0">Greenbelt data</a>, <a href="http://opendata.cityofboise.org/datasets/25eedd01c4e0404ea0f235d9033d2715_0">Foothills trail data</a>, mash up other APIs, or <a href="http://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=arts&amp;find_loc=Boise%2C+ID%2C+USA">non-food Yelp amenities</a>…</li>
  <li>Analyze <a href="http://opendata.cityofboise.org/datasets/9761f6acc23a49189ed7c0968bfc67c9_0">crashes that involve cyclists</a> and ARE reported to find patterns, seed the bike crash app mentioned in No. 1, save lives.</li>
  <li>Model future scenarios for transit in Boise, i.e. trains, planes and automobiles in 2030, 2040… perhaps a game?</li>
  <li>Put your favorite stuff on the map, the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_parties">OpenStreetMap</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>The hackathon has been open for some time, but convenes formally at Trailhead on Thursday, 3/24, after 7 pm, as kind of a formal kickoff (Hackfort opening party starts at 5 pm that evening). Finished apps are due at 9 am on Saturday, 3/26, and will be demoed at 3 pm, also at Trailhead, to be followed by the awarding of prizes.</em></p>

<p>See you @HackFortFest! (And remember that we also need designers, users, people who transport themselves, idea people — civic hacking is not just for hardcore programmers…)</p>
