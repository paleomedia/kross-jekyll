I"¶<p>In a bold, session ending type of move, the Senate adjourned until Monday hoping to get the House moving on transportation funding bills. House transportation leaders wonâ€™t give up the tax hike bills unless they get full passage of an audit. Grrr.</p>

<p>A film incentive bill passes a Senate committee, heads to full vote for final passage. Otter tells Boise State Radio about his Democrat dad. And today was supposed to be the last day of the sessionâ€¦ in todayâ€™s Newsrack.</p>

<p>[still updatingâ€¦ patience pleaseâ€¦]</p>

<p><strong>Otter vetoes $16.8 million for drug treatment programs.</strong> Not enough data that it works. Sen. Cameron: â€œWe have to either re-do the budget or have to consider whether or not we override the governor. Itâ€™s important to understand that what we did in that budget was not an increase over what we did last year. This was a maintenance of effort. We did not want to go backwards.â€ Russell in the <a href="http://www.spokesmanreview.com/breaking/story.asp?ID=14217">Spokesman</a>.

Stegner: â€œNowhere else have we set up a specific fund to bribe businesses to come to the state and receive a 20 percent discount. I donâ€™t think this is something the state of Idaho should engage in.â€ Dey in the <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/329484.html">Statesman</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Davis wants to know how REAL ID protest will affect INL.</strong> ACLUâ€™s Saona: â€œThe point of the bill is to not implement Real ID at all.
