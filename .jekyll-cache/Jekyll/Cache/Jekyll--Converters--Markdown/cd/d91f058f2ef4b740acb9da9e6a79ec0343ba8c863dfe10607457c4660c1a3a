I"¿<p><strong>From Caldwell, blogging at Voices.IdahoStatesman.com (do I hear voices?), Prof. Jasper LiCalzi handicaps the Treasure Valley races.</strong> LiCalzi is <a href="http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2008/05/20/licalzi/hot_races_in_the_treasure_valley_part_1">not afraid to be wrong</a>. He calls Canyon County for Bowers (who had someone knock on his door), Thayn who may benefit from a split vote and a possible upset in Olvera‚Äôs challenge to the entrenched Bob Schaefer.</p>

<p><a href="http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2008/05/21/licalzi/hot_races_in_the_treasure_valley_part_2">In Ada</a>, the prof thinks Merrill‚Äôs write-in has little chance, likes Winder in the District 14 Senate race (NOTE: Henry Kulczyk is no longer running. I just called him and he said he‚Äôs not running for ‚Äúpersonal reasons‚Äù. And, prof: it‚Äôs McDavid, not McDaniel‚Ä¶). Also, Hartnett with housing slump money bags and Snodgrass-McKague too close to call‚Ä¶</p>
