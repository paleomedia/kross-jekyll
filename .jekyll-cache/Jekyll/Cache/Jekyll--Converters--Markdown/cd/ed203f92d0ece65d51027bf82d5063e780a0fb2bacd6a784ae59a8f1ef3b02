<p>Tonight I am ‚Äúperforming‚Äù the first public presentation of my research to the <a href="http://igniteboise.com">Ignite Boise</a> crowd at the Egyptian Theater in Boise. It is a crowd heavy in tech, with a slightly palpable conservative bent ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm thinking of making my next Ignite Boise pitch an analysis of the politics of Ignite Boise, but that‚Äôs a different story.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also a free event, with beer, tailored to the short attention span set (AKA Twitter crowd). In other words, I have 5 minutes to convey 10 million years or so of immigration love stories. So I‚Äôm relying on some racy mental images in order to grab the crowd‚Äôs attention. But if anyone is interested in reading a bit deeper in this field, here are a few links I mention in my presentation.</p>

<p>For Census numbers, see:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=125">This recent study from the Pew Hispanic Center</a> discusses unauthorized (their term) immigrants and their U.S. born children, and gives some clues as to mixed-status couples. I am working on crunching more Census numbers, but need some new database skills first. Pew is the go-to source for <a href="http://pewhispanic.org/topics/?TopicID=16">immigration-related data</a>.</li>
