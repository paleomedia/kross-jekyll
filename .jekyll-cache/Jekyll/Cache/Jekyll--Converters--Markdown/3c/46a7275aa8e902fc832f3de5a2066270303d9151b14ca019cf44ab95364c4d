<p><strong>On Wednesday, the House Agricultural Affairs committee</strong> took a look at a series of rules on domestic cervidae farms — that is farms that raise elk, fallow deer and reindeer. The Legislature reviews state agency rules every year. A slew of bills in the 2007 Legislature sought to regulate elk ranches in the state, but all of them failed. A review of last year’s elk politics can be found <a href="http://www.headwatersnews.org/p.elk042307.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The rules are available <a href="http://adm.idaho.gov/adminrules/bulletin/08Pending/08_H&amp;S_Agricultural_Affairs.pdf">here</a> (large .pdf file, changes underlined) and recent changes would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define “harvest” as “domesticated livestock killed by a person if any portion of the carcass is salvaged” and ban leaving harvested animals to decompose naturally.</li>
  <li>Delete the definition of an elk feedlot</li>
  <li>Require domestic cervidae to have two forms of identification including at least one bangle or “lamb tag” that is visible from 150 feet.</li>
  <li>Require state and federal inspectors to comply with ranch biosecurity so long as it allows access and examination of records.</li>
  <li>Require domestic elk imported to Idaho to be treated with a paraciticide to prevent giant liver flukes.</li>
</ul>

<p>John Chatburn, an administrator at the Department of Ag, who also works for the governor’s office as a special assistant and is a state Racing Commissioner (and has to carry three different name tags at the Legislature) told me that new rules also allow a Canadian government seal of approval on cervidae imported into the U.S.</p>

<p>While two southwest Idaho elk breeders were at the Ag Committee meeting Wednesday, groups representing sportsmen who were active on the issue last year were not aware of the changes.</p>

<p>The rules are before the Senate Agriculture Committee on Thursday morning.</p>
