I"&<p>A watershed hearing is being held this morning on local option taxes for transit and transportation. The bill being debated is brought by an opponent of local option taxes and will be opposed by most local option supporters. Media reports this morning call that coalition fractured. Testimony at the hearing will tell, but it appears the counties were thrown a bone and peeled off to support amending the Constitution.</p>

<p>Luna’s final efforts to change teacher policy and pay failed Thursday when the Senate Education Committee decided against expediting teacher firings with opposition from school boards, who apparently asked for it in the first place. Also, Tamarack getting worried, grocery tax debate in Senate but not vote and honkers taking over the place… in today’s <a href="http://www.paleomedia.org/2008/03/14/local-transit-iea-grocery-tax/">Newsrack</a>.</p>
