I"„<p>The authors of Amor and Exile are commemorating the first year since publication by hosting an Amazon Kindle Countdown DealÂ today,Â Saturday, May 31st, through Monday, June 2nd, 2014.</p>

<p>We never would have guessed that a YEAR after delivering 635 books to Congress, immigration reform STILL wouldnâ€™t have passed! But the fight still continues.</p>

<p>To help get the word out there to the American public who can help us win this fight, weâ€™re practically giving it away copies of our Kindle version for $0.99 today, $1.99 tomorrow, andÂ $2.99 on Monday on <a href="http://amzn.to/11dNDPd" target="_blank">the Kindle store</a>. Regular sales price is $7.99. Kindle apps are available for almost every mobile device and laptops.</p>

<p>Please tell all your friends why you think they should download a copy. Or if you havenâ€™t yet, nowâ€™s a better time than ever to learn more about the laws affecting American families with undocumented spouses and their heartbreaking stories.</p>
