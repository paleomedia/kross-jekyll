And I think the dissatisfaction breeds some weird marriages.” Miller, AP in the <a href="http://www.idahopress.com/?id=10754">Press Tribune</a>. Also, Ron Paul Supporters in CDA and TF are in as delegates to state convention, but not in charge of the county parties. Kootenai Paulie Wisniewski: “What I am seeing at the county level is what they talked about in terms of Soviet-style elections.” In CDA they tried to get a do-over election.
