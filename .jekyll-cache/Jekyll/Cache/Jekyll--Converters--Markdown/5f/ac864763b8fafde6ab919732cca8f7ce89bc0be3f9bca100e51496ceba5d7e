I"Ö<p>All the papers have â€œLegislature Starts Todayâ€ headlines, or something like that. The Statesmanâ€™s Legislative pullout section has useful infoâ€¦ I usually hang onto it through the sessionâ€¦ the map will be helpful this year. Most of the â€œpreviewâ€ coverage is recycled, but a few new tidbits (a Cuba policy bill, some criticism of teacher pay efforts, and indication they may step into the water on water appropriations) today. Listen to the Legislature live from <a href="http://www.idahoptv.org/leglive/">this link</a>. [Refresh your browser for updates throughout the day]<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>Otter is Glad to Finally be in Charge</strong>. Stateâ€™s chief executive tells Statesman he was never a leader in Congress or on the Legislature. Now he can run the show. Also, Otter calls Lunaâ€™s teacher pay plan too much too soon, says he supports school vouchers and wants to keep the state out of siting nuke plants. Durzin and Popkey in the <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/389/story/255638.html">Statesman</a>. And, <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/389/story/255639.html">Popkey</a> says Otter more pragmatic in â€™08 than he was 30 years agoâ€¦ now willing to accept half a loaf. (Popkey also <a href="http://idahoptv.org/election2002/news/IDST29Sep02P.html">pointed this out</a> in 2002.)</p>

<p><strong>Speaker, Gov Chip Away at Lunaâ€™s Teacher Pay Plan</strong>. Speaker Denney: â€œMy calls are running almost equally from people who say that weâ€™re giving away too much, and people who say thatâ€™s a union-busting bill. So I have a feeling that itâ€™s probably not going to make it.â€ Anne Wallace Allen in the <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/localnews/story/255805.html">Statesman</a>.</p>

<p><strong>AP Calls Annex â€œMountain Climbing Inside a Doll House.â€</strong> Cramped hearing rooms, lynching mural, no galleriesâ€¦ Miller, AP in the <a href="http://www.idahopress.com/?id=2929">Press-Tribune</a>.</p>

<p><strong>No Public Galleries in House and Senate this Year.</strong> No rotunda for striking deals. Look for law makers out to lunch with lobbyists. Druzin in the <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/389/story/255629.html">Statesman</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Otter Wants to Up State Pay, Cut Bennies.</strong> Mike Gwartney, head of Admin, state employee: â€œMainly, the governor asked us to do this: I donâ€™t want a state employee to leave here because they could get a better deal on the benefit side anywhere else.â€ Russell in the <a href="http://www.spokesmanreview.com/idaho/story.asp?ID=226557">Spokesman Review</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Dem Plan for Grocery Tax Similar to Old Risch Plan.</strong> Former interim Gov. Risch: â€œIâ€™m flattered they would copy that. But, again, you have to keep in mind, that theyâ€™ve got to deal with the chief executive in this because heâ€™s the one responsible for putting the overall budget. Itâ€™s impossible for them to do something of that magnitude and also spend, spend, spend.â€ Jared S. Hopkins in the <a href="http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/01/05/news/top_story/128063.txt">Times-News</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Treasure Valley Caucus DOA?</strong> GOP members from West Ada and Canyon felt they were being lectured to by Ada Dems. Sen. David Langhorst: â€œTheyâ€™re saying people who are concerned about air quality, people who are concerned about transportation are Democrats. I think they need to think about that long and hard.â€ Druzin in the <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/localnews/story/256568.html">Statesman</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Rural Rep to Introduce Cuba Trade Memorial.</strong> Rep. Tom Trail wants the Feds to normalize trade with Cuba (and to make dog fighting a felony).

<p><strong>Local Option Tax Constitutional Amendment?</strong> House conservatives looking at changing the Constitution, but many who support local tax say itâ€™s a delay tactic. Twin Falls Mayor Lance Clow: â€œItâ€™s a local control question, and a local-option tax is something I think the people should be allowed to decide. The Legislature from Boise shouldnâ€™t be controlling all the decisions.â€ Jared S. Hopkins in the <a href="http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/01/07/news/local_state/128183.txt">Times-News</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Roark is New Idaho Democratic Party Chairman</strong>. Attorney Keith Roark is heading up the Idaho Democrats. Roark: â€œWhere there is no effective, two party system there is no accountability. Where there is no accountability there is no responsibility.
