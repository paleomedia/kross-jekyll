I"<p><strong>Nancy Merrill, former Eagle mayor, is running a write-in campaign against Mike Moyle.</strong> Merrill was thought to be interested in the District 14 seat, but she failed to file for election, citing family concerns. Now the Statesman says she’s running. Merrill: “I decided to finish what I started. We need experienced representation, and I have an 18-year record of consensus-building and getting things done.” Talbutt, <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/378423.html">Stateman</a>.</p>
