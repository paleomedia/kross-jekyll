I" <p><strong>Randy Stapilus</strong> at Ridenbaugh Press has <a href="http://www.ridenbaugh.com/index.php/2008/05/15/id-primaries-to-legislate-by/">winnowed out</a> our earlier list of 10 key primary races across the state. Since we <a href="http://www.paleomedia.org/2008/04/14/paleomediaorg’s-hot-10-primary-races/">picked our primaries</a> last month some of the field has changed.</p>

<p>Stapilus leads with the new race between former Eagle Mayor Nancy Merrill and Rep. Mike Moyle. But he does not give Merrill’s write-in campaign much cred. He also likes the Keough race in far North Idaho saying water adjudication has caused consternation in the district giving challenger Don Heckel a significant platform.</p>

<p>And Stapilus picks both House races in far East Idaho, including the open seat vacated by Larry Bradford. We agree that this grab-bag district is getting interesting.</p>

<p>One minor clarification to both our lists though: Kulczyk <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:giy4Ddd3-1sJ:www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/368449.html+kulczyk+drops+out&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us&amp;client=safari">has dropped out</a> of the popular District 14 race.</p>
