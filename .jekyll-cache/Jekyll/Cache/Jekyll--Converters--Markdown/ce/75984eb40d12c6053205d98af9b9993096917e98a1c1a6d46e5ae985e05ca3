I"³<p><strong>State schools chief Tom Luna in CDA touting progress at Legislature.</strong> Luna: â€œiSTARS was the closest Idaho has ever come to an improved teacher pay plan. It failed to pass the Senate by just one vote. I donâ€™t consider that a failure.â€ No merit pay plan. No concurrent enrollment. But thereâ€™s going to be a study.
