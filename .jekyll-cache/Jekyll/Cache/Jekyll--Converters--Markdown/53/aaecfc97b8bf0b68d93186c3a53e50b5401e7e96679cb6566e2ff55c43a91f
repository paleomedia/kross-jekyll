I"Ï<p>One of the coolest things I experienced on my recent trip to Mexico was making tamales from scratch with Nicole. Sheâ€™s already put together a <a href="http://www.losmesquites.com/nixtamal.htm">really good description of the process</a> on her website, so I merely add the video here, with a few comments.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sweet tamales with raisins and brown sugar are really good.</li>
  <li>I love the woman in the pink tank top. She was very proud of her masa and tried to school Nicole on cleaning the skins off the kernels better, but Nicole wasnâ€™t having any of it.</li>
  <li>I want access to a molino here in Boise â€¦ whoâ€™s in?</li>
  <li>Sorry about my finger over the lens in a few spots.</li>
