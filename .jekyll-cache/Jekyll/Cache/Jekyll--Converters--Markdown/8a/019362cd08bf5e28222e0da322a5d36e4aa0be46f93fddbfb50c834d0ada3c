I"3<p>A profusion of bills were heard last week with a bunch on the docket this morning as a Legislative deadline to introduce stuff is upon them. An interesting, if self-serving poll finds majority support for road and transit taxes, including local option tax, which has not been addressed prior to today’s committee deadline (bills can still be brought to a few, elite committees.)</p>

<p>Talk last week on teacher pay turned to compromise measures after Luna met (again) with the Education committees. It looks like the provision to trade merit pay for teacher contracts will not fly. Also a Cuba resolution, a pro forma elk bill and a new child death investigation program in today’s Newsrack…</p>

<p><strong>General Contractors’ poll finds support for road, local option tax.</strong> 62 percent in AGC poll say they support local sales tax hike for roads and transit. Otter pleased: “From what I know about it, folks seem to support my approach to addressing our transportation challenges. That’s encouraging.” Druzin in the <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/291442.html">Statesman</a>.</p>

<p><strong>iSTARS, union pay plan, not going anywhere.</strong> Friday secret meeting with Super and Ed committee chairs yields stalemate. Rep. Nonini, House Ed: “There’s no support for the current bills in their current form.” And axing continuing contracts not going to fly either, but may be some other way to fire teachers in the works.

<p><strong>Trail wants Pres., Congress to open trade with Cuba.</strong> Bill would urge feds to change policy. Governor will likely support it, given his strong advocacy on Cuba.

<p><strong>Private elk hunt ban reintroduced.</strong> No debate scheduled on “shooter bull” ban. Sen. David Langhorst: “I filed the bill just so it would get printed.

<p><strong>Beebe to challenge Thayn.</strong> Three term Canyon County Commissioner Matt Beebe will run in District 11 against controversial freshman Steven Thayn. Cites transportation as a major issue: “One of the issues we all face is we have tremendous transportation problems. Earlier I heard a pretty grim report from one of the representatives about no money for some of the projects. That’s certainly something that needs to be addressed.” John Meyer in the <a href="http://www.idahopress.com/?id=3733">Press Tribune</a>.</p>
