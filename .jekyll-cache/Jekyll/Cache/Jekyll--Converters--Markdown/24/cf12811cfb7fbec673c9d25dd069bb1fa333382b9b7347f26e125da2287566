Lee Heinrich in November.</strong> Doman: â€œAnd letâ€™s not forget that good government requires personal integrity and truly serving the community, not serving oneself or those who contribute to your staying in office.â€ Heinrich: â€œI now have two sessions under my belt and I believe that makes me much more effective as a legislator.â€ <a href="http://www.idahocountyfreepress.com/IFPNews1.shtml">Idaho County Free Press</a>.</p>
