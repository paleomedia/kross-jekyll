I"z<p><strong>10 Idaho legislators who were flown to East Idaho and back on a corporate jet in the heat of the 2008 legislative session have reported the jaunt as a campaign expense.</strong> From $300 to $550 reported in campaign expenses or in-kind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lawmakers flew to Idaho Falls from Boise for a GOP Lincoln Day event, then returned to the state capital, on a Learjet 45 owned by Melaleuca President Frank VanderSloot and a Beechcraft King Air turboprop owned by Allen Ball, a Melaleuca co-owner.<br />
At the time, lawmakers were considering legislation pushed by Melaleuca to strengthen an employerâ€™s ability to enforce noncompete agreements with employees. The bill passed the Senate 25-10 and the House 43-27 and takes effect July 1.</p>
