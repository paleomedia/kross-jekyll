I"o<p><strong>Boise Democrat Matt Yost filed suit against the Secretary of State hoping to get a spot on the District 15 ballot.</strong> Yost was disqualified in the District 15 Senate race against John Andreason because Sec. Ysursa deemed him unqualified for failure to register to vote in the district a year in advance. Yost attorney: “The analysis wrongfully bootstraps the ‘qualified elector’ status necessary for voting into the qualifications necessary to be a member of the state Senate.” Boone, AP in the <a href="http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/04/30/ap-state-id/d90bra400.txt">Times-News</a>.</p>
