<p><strong>Affording to be a law maker.</strong> Idaho legislators need to be able to afford to get away from their day jobs for three months. Per diem blank checks: “What they call per diem, it’s almost just like salaries because they don’t have to put in any receipts,” said Jasper LiCalzi, a College of Idaho professor of political economy. “Some say, ‘We want to run government like a business’ but no business runs a business without receipts… The other side of that is how many people do you want to be looking at receipts?” Power lunches too.

<p><strong>Airport has spent $17,000 prosecuting Craig.</strong> New brief asserts that Sen. Larry Craig did conduct himself disorderly: “Rather than reveling in his own privacy within his closed stall, he decided to penetrate the adjacent closed stall through multiple furtive movements of his eyes, feet and hands… It is this very calling of attention to himself and failing to remain within his closed stall that is the basis for the charges and the appellant’s plea.” Bolstad in the <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/303517.html">Statesman</a>. <strong>Craig cheered in Burley.</strong> Craig presented with painting says it’s just on loan until he leaves office: “We’re going to remain ethically correct for the remaining nine months.” Greene, <a href="http://www.southidahopress.com/articles/2008/02/23/news/local/9651craig.txt">South Idaho Press</a>.</p>
