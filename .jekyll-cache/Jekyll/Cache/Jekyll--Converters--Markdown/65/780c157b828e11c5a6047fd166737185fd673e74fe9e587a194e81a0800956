<ul>
  <li>Anthony Burgess wrote <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> in three weeks. (2,785 words/day)</li>
  <li>Robert Louis Stevenson wrote <em>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em> in less than a week. (4,343 words/day)</li>
  <li>Jack Kerouac wrote <em>On the Road</em> in 20 days. (5,770 words/day)</li>
  <li>Georges Simenon wrote <em>The Snow Was Black</em> in less than two weeks. (3,640 words/day)</li>
  <li>Ray Bradbury wrote <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> in nine days on a rented typewriter. (5,086 words/day)</li>
</ul>

<p>Missing: A mention of Hunter S. Thompson’s famed writing binges.</p>

<p>So what’s my problem?</p>
