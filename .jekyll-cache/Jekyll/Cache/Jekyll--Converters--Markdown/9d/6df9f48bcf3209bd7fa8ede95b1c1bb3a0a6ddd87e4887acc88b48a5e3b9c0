I"´<p>My <a href="http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/idahos-cuban-connection/Content?oid=1767235">cameo in the Boise Weekly</a> waxing in-eloquently on Cuba did not result in a call from Fidel. It would have been nice if <a href="http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/butch-vs-the-embargo/Content?oid=931876">heâ€™d read this</a>, and had some follow up questions though.</p>

<p>But Jeffrey Goldbergâ€™s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/09/the-point-of-no-return/8186">recent piece on Iran and Israel</a> earned him an invitation to the island for a chat with Castro. Goldberg is <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/09/fidel-to-ahmadinejad-stop-slandering-the-jews/62566/">blogging about his visit</a> and his special trip to the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/09/fidel-cuban-model-doesnt-even-work-for-us-anymore/62602/">Havana Aquarium</a>. Iâ€™m burying his lead, but the aquarium scene was even better than the part where he said that the Cuban model does not work for Cuba anymore.</p>
