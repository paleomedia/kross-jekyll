I"õ<p>For a few weeks now Iâ€™ve been intermittently tweeting about <a href="http://mainsite.radioboise.org/">Radio Boise</a> (and not blogging at all). Here is a collection of tweets in time order using <a href="http://storify.com/paleomedia">Storify</a> to organize them.</p>

<p>I went to the official ribbon cutting ceremony last week and was surprised at how excited I really was. Iâ€™ve always been on board with the idea of community radio in Boise and I remember going to the very first meeting some eight years ago when it all started. But I also kept a little distance from the effort, at first not thinking I had much to offer, then not sure if it was for real or not, and most recently trying to remain objective as a journalist covering the story (someone actually asked me if I was there to cover the ribbon cutting and I was thrilled to reply that no, Iâ€™m just there because I love the idea).</p>

<p>But now that itâ€™s on the air and a new voice in the Idaho media landscape, Iâ€™m embracing the station fully. I grew up listening to Morgan State Universityâ€™s community radio programming and fell in love with Caribbean music from a young age. Hereâ€™s to a generation of Boise kids growing up with a new universe of music and ideas and culture. Much respect to Jeff Abrams and the entire Radio Boise crew for pulling this off.</p>
