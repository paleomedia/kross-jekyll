I"4<p>PaleoMedia sort of sat out the last day of the session, but when we stopped by the Annex about 5 PM reps were already vacating the premises, boxes in hand, and senators were still talking to each other about how great they all are.</p>

<p>Look for Paleo 2.0 possibly as soon as next week. (Has anyone noticed the little “Donate” button toward the top of the Front Page?)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, more legislative wrapup stories to come tomorrow, but there is wolf hunting in Wyoming, an interesting take on GOP primary politics and a bunch of copy on the going home bills in today’s Newsrack…</p>

<p><strong>Senate Republicans approve call-for ballot idea to help GOP Chairman.</strong> House lets it die. Sen. Geddes: “We felt like we needed to take some action.
