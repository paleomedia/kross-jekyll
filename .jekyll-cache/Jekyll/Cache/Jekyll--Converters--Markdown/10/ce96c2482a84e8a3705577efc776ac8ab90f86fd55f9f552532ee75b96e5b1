I"€<p>Just figured out how to Google virtually from Mexico, or any other locale. Just go to <a href="http://www.google.com.mx/">http://www.google.com.mx/</a> and surf as if you were in Mexico (h/t <a href="http://boisestategreenguy.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/google-en-espana/">Boise State Green Guy in Bilbao</a>). If you want to find other Google localizations, just Google whatever country you want to search from and ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù and it will probably be the first result.</p>
