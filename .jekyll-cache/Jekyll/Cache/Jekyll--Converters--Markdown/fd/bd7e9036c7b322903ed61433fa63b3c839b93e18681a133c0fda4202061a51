I"Õ<p>Cue the trumpets: Wednesday‚Äôs political theater included letter writing and press baiting at the unnamed venue next to Bardenay. Gov. Otter, who often says he doesn‚Äôt want to work things out through the press, worked the press hard at a luncheon with the Idaho Press Club, a group of Boise State University coeds and a man who wants him to run for president.</p>

<p>Otter pulled back his road funding bills saying legislators did not appreciate his efforts to provide them political cover so he‚Äôs withdrawing the cover. Legislative leaders said it was fine. The ball is rolling.</p>
