I"2<p>They say imitation is the highest form of flatteryâ€¦ And on the internet I wholeheartedly agree. The Statesman has adopted PaleoMedia.orgâ€™s Newsrack concept for <a href="http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2008/04/04/idahonewsreader/welcome_to_water_season">herself</a>. They call it the News Reader.</p>

<p>We stole the idea from <a href="http://rtumble.com">Rough and Tumble</a> and Slateâ€™s <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2188238/">Todayâ€™s Papers</a>. So thatâ€™s cool.</p>

<p>And David Parker has some fine links this morning including an interview with <a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/the-inside-job/2008/04/03/finished-sentences-interiors-dirk-kempthorne.html">Dirk</a> and, well, thatâ€™s the most interesting one.</p>

<p>So weâ€™re taking the day off. PaleoMedia 2.0 coming next week. ðŸ˜‰</p>
