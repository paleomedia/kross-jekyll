I"p<p>The main event Thursday was a minor squirming induced on the State Board of Education, members of which were forced to answer two hours of questioning by the Senate Education Committee. Board members held fast in their blaming of the staff.</p>

<p>Not asked, as far as Paleo can tell: Where has Idaho education come under the Board’s tenure. Just a forest and trees question.</p>

<p>The midwife licensing bill passed a sloppy Health and Welfare Committee meeting followed immediately by a sloppy abortion coercion bill.</p>

<p>And transportation fights have just begun… in today’s Newsrack.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
