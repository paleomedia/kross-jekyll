I",<p><strong>Rod Beck will challenge Idaho GOP chairman Kirk Sullivan at the party convention in June.</strong> Boise water lobbyist and former U.S. House candidate Norm Semanko had considered a run but will only stand for election if Sullivan is doomed. Beck: “I was more than happy to support Norm Semanko. But if he’s not a candidate, I’m going to make sure there is a candidate in opposition. We’re going to have a vote, and I expect to win.” Miller, AP in <a href="http://www.theolympian.com/northwest/story/457157.html">The Olympian</a>.</p>
