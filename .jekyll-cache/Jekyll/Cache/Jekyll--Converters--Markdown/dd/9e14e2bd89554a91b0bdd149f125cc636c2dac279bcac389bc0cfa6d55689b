I":<p>More transportation silt broke loose Friday when the budget committee approved another round of highway bonding for several Boise Valley projects, and Otter reportedly reached a deal on local option taxing for transportation needs. Otter got credit for his first major scores with the Legislature. Also, emission testing powers for DEQ finally passed the House after four years of effort.</p>

<p>Otter has two wildly popular NIMBY bills on his desk dealing with transitional housing in neighborhoods… he has indicated he may not sign one or both. The Senate Education Committee is <a href="http://www.paleomedia.org/2008/03/07/goedde-refuses-hearing-on-in-state-tuition-for-undocumented/">holding a bill</a> that would help more undocumented students in Idaho go to college, and more election announcements, galore, in today’s Newsrack.</p>
