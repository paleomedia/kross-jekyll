I"¯<p>The Idaho Press-Tribune announced 16 layoffs Wednesday, but publisher Rick Weaver said editorial staff has not been cut.</p>

<p>â€œBusiness is just bad,â€ Weaver said. â€œIf the economy was better we wouldnâ€™t be doing it.â€</p>

<p>The Canyon County paper <a href="http://www.idahopress.com/?id=12082">posted a story</a> Wednesday afternoon announcing the layoffs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œEven though the economy is currently bad, there are many positive things at the Press-Tribune, including home delivery and single copy sales reaching new records. Combined with our growing online audience, the total Press-Tribune readership is higher than at any point in history.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Layoffs will affect the entire building, but Weaver said editorial staff will not be let go.<br />
Last month the paper announced a joint printing deal with the Idaho Statesman in which the smaller, Nampa-based paper will begin printing the Statesman. But that deal will not produce revenue for the Press-Tribune until next year, Weaver said.</p>

<p>The Statesman announced 16 layoffs last month at the same time as the joint printing contract was made public and also said an additional 20 layoffs would come when the Press-Tribune takes over printing.</p>

<p>The Press-Tribune which is owned by Pioneer Newspapers, gave employees two weeks notice and some type of severance package that may include a health coverage option through November.</p>
