<p><strong>Davis: Idaho needs a revolving door.</strong> At least 8 former lawmakers or governor staff have moved into lobbying in the past year. Sen. Minority Leader Clint Stennett: “We’re using public money in order to help promote the careers and give these individuals the access that they have.” And Sen. Majority Leader Bart Davis: “For Idaho, it seems to be more of a solution in search of a problem.” John Miller, AP in <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/ID_REVOLVING_DOOR_IDOL-?SITE=IDNCP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">IPT</a>.

<p><strong>Luna, IEA sqaure off on teacher pay</strong>. Debate at AP Legislative preview forum focuses on teacher job security and basis for supplemental pay. Rep.
