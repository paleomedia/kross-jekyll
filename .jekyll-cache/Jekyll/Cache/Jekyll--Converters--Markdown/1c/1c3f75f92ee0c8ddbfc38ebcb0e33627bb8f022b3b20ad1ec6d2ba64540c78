I"*<p>The changes in focus at ICE, the immigration enforcement arm of Homeland Security, have been leaking out for a few months now. ProPublica.org has a fine overview story this morning linking to the primary documents that <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/administration-takes-steps-that-will-reduce-deportation-risks-for-non-crimi">add up to a new policy on deportations</a>: seeking out actual criminals and leaving the rest of the undocumented population more or less alone. I just added ProPublica to my blogroll because of this report.</p>
