I"<p>Bikes anyone? Otter threw up his hands in disgust with the Legislature’s failure to fund his $240 million hole in the state road system. Fine, reply lawmakers. We’re outta here then…</p>

<p>But not so quick. Legislature could have a few more days work after the Senate trimmed back a repeal of business equipment taxes for the largest Idaho businesses, or for equipment intensive Idaho businesses, if you take the industry line. It now goes bak to the House for a grumpy approval.</p>

<p>Wolves are off the list, Ed Board says sorry and not much else in today’s Newsrack…</p>
