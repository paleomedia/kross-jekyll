I"ˆ<p>Iâ€™m doing some reading on the open data movement for a new project that we will announce in a few weeks and came across anÂ interesting history ofÂ the human genome project. Iâ€™m looking at links between the open data movement, which is mostly concerned with public, government information and its release in free, usable, digital formats, and open data in academia â€” university research data â€” which is often treated as private or somehow protected information.</p>

<p>In 2011, Jorge Contreras wrote about the Bermuda Principles in theÂ <em>Minnesota Journal of Law, Science &amp; Technology</em> (<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1667659">SSRN link</a>). The <a href="http://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/research/bermuda.shtml">Bermuda Principles</a>, agreed to in 1996â€¦ in Bermuda, stated that human genome research data should be released to the public within 24 hours of being collected.</p>

<p>According to Contreras, key researchers and genetic policy thinkers agreed to Bermuda for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To aid project coordination,</li>
  <li>to advance science, and</li>
  <li>Â to minimize encumbrances to research that patents on the human genome would cause.</li>
</ol>

<p>Number three is very interesting and certainly has application in other areas of the sciences. But the bigger concept that Contreras analyzes â€” the idea of openness and data sharing in scientific research also applies in many other areas.</p>

  <span class="quote">As discussed above, the more quickly scientific data isÂ disseminated, the more quickly science will progress.Â Conversely, when the release of data is delayed due to theÂ length of the publication cycle and patenting concerns, it can beÂ argued that the progress of scientific advancement is retarded,Â or at least that it may not achieve its greatest potential. If dataÂ were not withheld until a researcherâ€™s conclusions wereÂ published, but released prior to publication, the months-longÂ delays associated with the publishing process could be avoided.Â <strong>Following this line of argument, in an ideal world, maximumÂ scientific efficiency could be achieved by reducing the delayÂ between data generation and data release to zero.</strong> That is, theÂ most rapid pace of innovation, discovery of new therapies,Â development of new technologies, and understanding of naturalÂ phenomena could be achieved by releasing scientific data to theÂ community the moment it is generated. &#8212;Â Jorge L.

  More on this later, but it dawns on me that <a href="https://github.com/showcases/science">Github</a> is basically designed to reduce the delay between data generation and data release to almost zero: update, add, commit, push and the public has a current and historical view of your data manipulations.
