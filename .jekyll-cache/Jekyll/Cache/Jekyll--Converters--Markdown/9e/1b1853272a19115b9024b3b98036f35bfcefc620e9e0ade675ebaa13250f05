I"<p><strong>Federal minimum wage hikes go into effect Thursday, giving Idaho’s working poor a piece of bootstrap.</strong> 70 cent/hour raises go to about 42,000 Idaho workers, costing employers some $24 million per year. (Not sure exactly how that pencils out though… any accountants out there… We got more like $61 million.) Washington and Oregon minimum wages are about $1.50 more. Next year, federal minimum wage jumps to $7.25. Russell in the <a href="http://www.spokesmanreview.com/breaking/story.asp?ID=15827">Spokesman</a>.</p>
