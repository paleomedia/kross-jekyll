I"l<p>PaleoMedia.org producer Nathaniel Hoffman has been named News Editor at the <a href="http://www.boiseweekly.com">Boise Weekly</a>.</p>

<p>So if this site has suffered for the past few weeks, itâ€™s because we were trying to get our head around the rhythms at the Weekly and how things work in City Hall, the County Courthouse and the soon-to-be-grittier streets of Capital City. Sorry for the virtual lapse. We fully intend to keep Paleo going strong, as a complement to the ratcheted-up coverage every week in the Boise Weekly.</p>

<p>So stay tuned, stay in touch and tell you friends to check us out. Thanks!</p>
