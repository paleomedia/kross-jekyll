I"œ<p><strong>Gooding Co. SO broke up a cockfight Sunday night on a dairy near Wendell.</strong> 9 arrests, 20 vehicles impounded. Birds may have come from Cali, rising the possibility of federal charges. Humane Societyâ€™s Rosenthal: â€œCockfighting is almost always associated with other criminal enterprises such as gambling and drug dealing. The transport of the birds carries both human disease risks and disease risks to the poultry industry. Additionally these matches involve terrible cruelty and abuse inflicted upon the animals.â€ Bawk. <a href="http://www.ktvb.com/news/localnews/stories/ktvbn-jul2908-cockfighting_gooding_county.14cff0da.html">KTVB</a>.</p>
