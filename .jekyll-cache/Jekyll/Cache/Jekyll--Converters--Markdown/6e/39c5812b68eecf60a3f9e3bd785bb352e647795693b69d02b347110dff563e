I"æ<p>A deal on local option tax for transit appears stalled now that major transit groups have withdrawn support for the compromise. Valley Regional Transit and COMPASS met Friday and opposed or took no position respectively on running a Constitutional amendment to authorize local taxing. Republican House leaders are moving forward with their plan anyway and it could be up to Democrats to lend support or squash the compromise measure.</p>

<p>While only about six people showed up, a rally for transit and against changing the Constitution in Nampa did get some coverage.</p>
