I"§<p>In a delicate dance with the Legislature and the Governor, a Boise Valley transit coalition is pulling in more members from across the state and calling itself Moving Idaho Forward.

And Boise Weeklyâ€™s <a href="http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A310082">Legislative column</a> is back, penned by PaleoMedia editor Nathaniel Hoffman.<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>Undaâ€™ the Rotuna Back.</strong> Is Lunaâ€™s teacher pay plan really doomed or are they just saying that? And why is it tied to teacher contracts? Jim Carlson of the Educator Compensation Institute: â€œItâ€™s a significant departure, and it seems an odd marriage that the quid pro quo would be tenure at a time when we as a nation are facing teacher shortages.â€ Hoffman in the <a href="http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A310082">BW</a>.

The local option tax is a prime example.â€ AP in the <a href="http://www.idahostatejournal.com/articles/2008/01/09/ap-state-id/d8u1t0d82.txt">State Journal</a>.
