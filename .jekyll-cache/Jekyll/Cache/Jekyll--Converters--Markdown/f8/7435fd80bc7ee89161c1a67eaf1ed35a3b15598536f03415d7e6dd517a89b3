I"E<p><strong>I didn’t know him well, but I have had dinner with Maj. Stuart Wolfer, our daughters played together a bit and then he was killed in Iraq.</strong> Even when I heard that two local soldiers had been killed a few weeks ago it did not hit me in the gut. Only when I realized it was Wolfer and that I knew his family did my stomach sink. We go about our daily business totally unaware that we are at war. Then it hits home.
