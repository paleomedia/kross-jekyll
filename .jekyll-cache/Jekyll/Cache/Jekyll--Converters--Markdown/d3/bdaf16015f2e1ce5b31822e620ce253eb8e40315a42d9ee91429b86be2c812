I"T<p><strong>Lt. Gov. Jim Risch will air his tax cut ad again, claiming $200+ million in cuts during his tenure as gov.</strong> Does not mention his concomitant sales tax hike. Risch: “I said it then, I mean it now, and you’re going to hear it again in the election.” LaRocco’s got one too that only mentions the sales tax hike, not the property tax cut part. LaRocco: “He said he wouldn’t raise taxes, and he raised sales taxes on people across the board and working families.” Russell in the <a href="http://www.spokesmanreview.com/idaho/topstory.asp?ID=254469">Spokesman</a>.</p>
