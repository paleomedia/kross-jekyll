I"ˆ<p>In a moment of clarity, I realized that my ipod screen is roughly the size of a 3Ã—5 index card. So Iâ€™m putting my notes for tonightâ€™s Ignite Boise 5 right on the ipod, solving two problems: (1) the screen is backlit so I can actually read it on stage and (2) I can scroll down with one finger, leaving the other hand free to hold the mic.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m just formatting the notes into a 20-page (20 slides=20 pages) Word doc with roughly 3 inch page width and e-mailing it to myself. Anyone who wants to make an iphone app that does this in a slicker way (maybe incorporating timing, or auto-scrolling) is hereby free to steal the idea.</p>
