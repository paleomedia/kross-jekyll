I"F<p><strong>Rosemary P. Ardinger, Boise County Planning and Zoning Commissioner and former Department of Education administrator is challenging Mountain Home Republican Milton Peter “Pete” <a href="http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=18080">Nielsen</a> in November.</strong> Ardinger, a Democrat who lives off of Highway 21, worked for three state supers, wants to bring education knowledge to Legislature. Ardinger: “We’ve seen too many bad examples in other states where sprawl has overrun infrastructure. I’ll be a diligent voice for responsible growth, quality education, quality of life, and the economic benefits growth can bring.” Nielsen is a farmer and insurance agent from Mountain Home who wears awesomely polyester suits. <a href="http://www.mountainhomenews.com/story/1402597.html">Mountain Home News.</a></p>
