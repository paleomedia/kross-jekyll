Labrador on Ted Kennedy. Obama at Pizza Hut. Durst on speeding tix. Pence on political passions. Your generation runs Capitol Hill. 

Drew Allen of Drew&#8217;s Nugget of the Month and [Peppershock Media](http://peppershock.com/) has the audio from the Boise Young Professionals [For the Love of Politics](http://peppershock.com/drewblog/2008/03/for-love-of-politics-byp-event-podcast.html).
