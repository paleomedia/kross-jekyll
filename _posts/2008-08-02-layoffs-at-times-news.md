**Another 14 newspaper layoffs announced, this time at the Times-News in Twin Falls.** Consolidation, usually a dirty word in newspapers, will allow 14 layoffs between the Times-News and the South Idaho Press and a series of community weeklies in the &#8220;Magic&#8221; Valley. This comes on the heals of layoffs at the Idaho Press-Tribune last week as well. Staff at [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/08/02/news/local_state/141562.txt).
