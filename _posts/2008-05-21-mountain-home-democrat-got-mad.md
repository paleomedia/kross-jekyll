**G. Rustyn Casiano is running for the Legislature because &#8220;she got mad.&#8221;** Mountain Home Democrat/retired Air Force medical corpsman will challenge Rep. Tim Corder or [Clayton Cramer](http://www.claytoncramer.com/weblog/2008_05_18_archive.html#8008751979942803857), if he is victorious in next week&#8217;s primary. Casiano likes balanced budgets, vouchers, charters, open meetings. Casiano: &#8220;I&#8217;d like to see some open meetings. I think the public should see what&#8217;s going on before they pass the laws.. It&#8217;s all about access and taxes. I don&#8217;t think people know what&#8217;s going on.&#8221; [Mountain Home News](http://www.mountainhomenews.com/story/1402596.html).
