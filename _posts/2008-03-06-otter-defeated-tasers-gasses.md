Cue the trumpets: Wednesday&#8217;s political theater included letter writing and press baiting at the unnamed venue next to Bardenay. Gov. Otter, who often says he doesn&#8217;t want to work things out through the press, worked the press hard at a luncheon with the Idaho Press Club, a group of Boise State University coeds and a man who wants him to run for president. 

Otter pulled back his road funding bills saying legislators did not appreciate his efforts to provide them political cover so he&#8217;s withdrawing the cover. Legislative leaders said it was fine. The ball is rolling. 

Also radioactivity, Tasers and global warming in today&#8217;s Newsrack.

**Otter sends a letter.** Governor writes to the Legislature withdrawing his three transportation funding bills. Speaker: Maybe he should just sit down and talk to us. Sen. Minority Leader: &#8220;The governor can take away the element of surprise by including people in his plans.&#8221; Several more road funding plans in the works. Latest in a string of rejections for Otter. Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/315649.html). Otter: &#8220;They&#8217;re standing for election, and I&#8217;m not.&#8221; Shifrin, AP in the [Press Tribune](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/ID_XGR_TRANSPORTATION_FUNDING_IDOL-?SITE=IDNCP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT). Russell in the [Spokesman](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/breaking/story.asp?ID=13983). Legislators want to raise $100 million for roads, not $200 million. Ferguson in the [LMT](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/15920/) [subscrip].

**Budgeters pull back teacher pay plan and rework it.** Wednesday plan distributes raises across the salary schedule instead of tinkering with it. Teachers like it better, Luna can live with it. Miller, AP in the [Press Tribune](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/ID_XGR_TEACHER_PAY_IDOL-?SITE=IDNCP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT). Luna: It&#8217;s a good budget, considering.

**20 senators vote against greenhouse gas study.** Sen. Kate Kelly: First time climate change discussed on Senate floor. Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/315648.html). No more notable than WWII vets reaching a consensus on long hair and pants on women. Ferguson in the [LMT](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/15922/) [subscrip].

**Two bills focus on stun guns.** One keeps them out of the hands of criminals. The other designates them concealed weapons so that Rep.

**Timeline on Sabia radioactive leak.** People were not notified quickly. Bonneville County Commish: &#8220;It&#8217;s disappointing. We have a whole team set up to deal with things like this.&#8221; Company never dialed 911. [Times News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/03/06/ap-state-id/d8v7krs80.txt).

Davidson in the [Post Register](http://www.postregister.com/story.php?accnum=1004-03062008&today=2008-03-06%2000:00:00). 

**Otter backs changes to State Education Board.** Otter: &#8220;The bottom line is Iwant the State Board out of the management business and back into the policy business.&#8221; Give testing back to Department of Education, let college presidents do their jobs. He has interviewed several candidates for possible appointment to the board and has met with board members.

**Learning to lobby.** Midwife from IF living at the Statehouse, coaxing her bill through the chambers. Michell Bartlett: &#8220;I&#8217;m new to all this, and it is very scary.&#8221; [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/story/312629.html).
