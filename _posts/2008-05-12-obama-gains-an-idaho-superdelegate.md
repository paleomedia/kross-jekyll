**Keith Roark, Idaho&#8217;s Democratic Party Chief, said today he will back Sen. Barack Obama, NewWest.net is reporting.** Roark: “My lingering concerns about Senator Obama’s ability to take hard punches and keep going were laid to rest with the results of the primary contests last week in North Carolina and Indiana.” Kuraitis at [NewWest.net](http://www.newwest.net/city/article/idaho_superdelegates_united_for_obama/C108/L108/). BW [was at the same press conference](http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A313790). Last week Roark said the [same thing](http://www.paleomedia.org/2008/05/08/roark-all-but-backs-obama/) but would not commit to Obama. PaleoMedia.org didn&#8217;t get the memo. 🙂
