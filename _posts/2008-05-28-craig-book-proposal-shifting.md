**Sen. Larry Craig, who [has said previously that he intends to write a book](http://www.paleomedia.org/2008/04/10/craig-to-write-energy-book/) upon retirement, was marketing his forthcoming work on Primary night.** Only now the tome is about America&#8217;s energy future and how the media and blogosphere got him all wrong. Craig: &#8220;There will be a bit of what&#8217;s happened in the last year, and the way it evolved. I think that&#8217;s important for Idaho and those outside Idaho who are interested to know.&#8221; Craig having one-way sinecure conversations.
