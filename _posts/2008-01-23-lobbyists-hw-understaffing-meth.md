A survey conducted last fall and released by the Idaho Meth Project Tuesday shows that Idaho youth know quite a bit about meth and are not overwhelmingly concerned about the drug. Talk at the Legislature has turned to Health and Welfare funding this week, specifically funding for housing mentally ill people. Also, workplace discrimination against gays and lesbians may not be addressed by the Senate, an updated definition of lobbying is in the works according to the [BW](http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A310465) and an interim state bighorn sheep-domestic sheep plan is nearly complete&#8230;

**Colleges ask for access to building fund monies.** Boise State&#8217;s Marty Peterson: &#8220;There are no requirements that any money has to go into it at all, but what we would hope is that in times where there&#8217;s a little bit of budget surplus, and the state is looking for one-time expenditures, they&#8217;ll look at this fund as a place to put some money and let higher education go out and match it with nonstate sources.&#8221; Allen in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/272676.html).
