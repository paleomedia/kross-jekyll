Lt. Gov. Risch and Idaho conservationists were in DC yesterday to testify on a proposed roadless plan. A [series of meetings will be held](http://www.roadless.fs.fed.us/documents/idaho_roadless/idaho_rdless_public_mtg_%20info.pdf) around the state for those who couldn&#8217;t make it. Wolf kill and grizzly legislation is introduced along with bills making embezzlement and shooting your neighbor&#8217;s dog a felony. And Ed Board chairman meets the budgeters. <!--more-->

**Risch mostly backs FS roadless rule.** Back in DC, former gov testifies along with dozes of Idaho residents. Risch: &#8220;I think that the language that we come up should be language that makes it very clear that temporary roads can be built only for stewardship purposes and not commercial harvesting purposes.

I want to be sure that the final language that we come up with says exactly that.&#8221; Bolstad in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/235/story/264907.html).

We just want to keep things the way they are.&#8221; Matthew Daly, AP in the [Press Tribune](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/W/WST_IDAHO_ROADLESS_IDOL-?SITE=IDNCP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT).
