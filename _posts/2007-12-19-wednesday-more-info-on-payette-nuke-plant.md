title: Info on Payette Nuke Plant

author: Nathaniel Hoffman
excerpt: |
  Whether state or county officials should have veto power over siting of nuclear (and coal) power plants in Idaho was discussed in the 2007 Legislative session, but not resolved. The prospect of a nuclear plant in Payette and another in Owyhee County will focus this debate in the upcoming session.<p>
  
  Also, new reports on health care in Idaho and Moscow City Hall's decision to offer insurance to domestic partners could test the state's gay marriage laws. Or not.
