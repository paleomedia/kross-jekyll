Minuteman founder Chris Simcox spoke last night at Boise State&#8230; I intended to go, but didn&#8217;t make it. You can read the Arbiter&#8217;s take [here](http://media.www.arbiteronline.com/media/storage/paper890/news/2007/12/03/News/Simcox.Enflames.Immigration.Debate-3133222.shtml) and Channel 2 [has a story](http://www.2news.tv/news/local/12133676.html) too.
