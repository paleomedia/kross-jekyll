**Nampa library workers ask the board to restore sex books to shelves.** Librarian: &#8220;By placing the books in the director&#8217;s office, the board has gone against the mission, vision and values of the library.&#8221; Boise Public Library orders Joy of Gay Sex as part of normal acquisition plan. Rodine in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/352380.html). And: “Forcing library customers to ask a staff member for access to these books from a locked office violates their right to privacy and confidentiality.” Butts in the [Press Tribune](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=7571).
