Wired Magazine (alas, no link at wired.com) digs up five quick writers from the days before people wrote novels in a month:

  * Anthony Burgess wrote _A Clockwork Orange_ in three weeks. (2,785 words/day)
  * Robert Louis Stevenson wrote _The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ in less than a week. (4,343 words/day)
  * Jack Kerouac wrote _On the Road_ in 20 days. (5,770 words/day)
  * Georges Simenon wrote _The Snow Was Black_ in less than two weeks. (3,640 words/day)
  * Ray Bradbury wrote _Fahrenheit 451_ in nine days on a rented typewriter. (5,086 words/day)

Missing: A mention of Hunter S. Thompson&#8217;s famed writing binges.

So what&#8217;s my problem?
