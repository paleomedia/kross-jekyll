My [cameo in the Boise Weekly](http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/idahos-cuban-connection/Content?oid=1767235) waxing in-eloquently on Cuba did not result in a call from Fidel. It would have been nice if [he&#8217;d read this](http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/butch-vs-the-embargo/Content?oid=931876), and had some follow up questions though.

But Jeffrey Goldberg&#8217;s [recent piece on Iran and Israel](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/09/the-point-of-no-return/8186) earned him an invitation to the island for a chat with Castro. Goldberg is [blogging about his visit](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/09/fidel-to-ahmadinejad-stop-slandering-the-jews/62566/) and his special trip to the [Havana Aquarium](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/09/fidel-cuban-model-doesnt-even-work-for-us-anymore/62602/). I&#8217;m burying his lead, but the aquarium scene was even better than the part where he said that the Cuban model does not work for Cuba anymore.
