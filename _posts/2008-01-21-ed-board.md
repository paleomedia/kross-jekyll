Last Friday, the interim director of the State _Board_ of Education [broached the idea](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/idaho/topstory.asp?ID=228446) of turning some programs back to the _Department_ of Education&#8230; where they used to reside. This week opens with four days of testimony on teacher merit pay in joint education committee meetings in the JR Williams (Hall of Mirrors) Building at 3 p.m. Also, an [interesting story](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=3244) on ballooning youth mental health services in Eastern Idaho and more in today&#8217;s Newsrack&#8230;

**Ed Board ED: We shan&#8217;t run programs.** Idaho Board of Education should stick to policy and not try to run programs. Sen. Hammond, former Ed Board member: &#8220;Just like any board, their chief purpose is policy-setting, and when they try to get too much into the operational side, it just creates inefficiencies.&#8221; Bill to put testing back in the Department of Ed expected. Russell in the [Spokesman](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/idaho/topstory.asp?ID=228446) [partial access].

**Pre-K: Long history of going nowhere.** In Idaho House, that is. Schroeder, Burkett will try again to get early childhood education started. Speaker Denney: &#8220;We&#8217;ll try to get a hearing. I have not been convinced that it&#8217;s necessary. However, I&#8217;m not privileged to whatever the Senate heard that makes them think it&#8217;s very necessary.&#8221; Denney&#8217;s granddaughter goes to public pre-K. Allen in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/269299.html).

**Children&#8217;s mental health programs in Eastern Idaho have three times as much business as Boise, elsewhere in the state**. Providers are raking in the Medicaid dollars and not necessarily using the best techniques. Are docs pulling a fast one, parents shopping for diagnoses or is the region the only one in the state actually treating all its mentally ill kids?

**Pedophile sentencing: Depends on the judge.** Post-Register examines sentencing history for sex offenders and finds punishments are pretty subjective.

**Otter decides not to fund alternative energy center in Idaho Falls**. Center for Advanced Energy Studies expected $3.8 million in governor&#8217;s budget. Gets zero. Will study nuke and other alternative energies. Davidson in the [Post Register](http://www.postregister.com/story.php?accnum=1001-01192008&today=2008-01-19) [subscrip].

**Heard around the Annex: &#8220;Excuse me.&#8221;** Cramped quarters lead to hyper politeness. Voting on laptops. Bedke: &#8220;You have to be on time to get booted up. You can&#8217;t just run in and punch your &#8216;present&#8217; button.&#8221; Hopkins in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/01/21/news/top_story/129145.txt).

That thing goes straight down.&#8221; Simon Shifrin, AP in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/269306.html).
