I never got a proper kaffiyeh, though I did wear a really shitty, touristy one for many years, until it disintegrated in the desert. But I am prepared with my Egyptian worker hat, repping the Revolution in Boise. It&#8217;s still too cold for flip flops, but in a few months we can all break those out too.

[I got this hat during my [1998 Trip in Egypt.](http://www.paleomedia.org/2011/02/07/my-1998-trip-in-egypt/)]
