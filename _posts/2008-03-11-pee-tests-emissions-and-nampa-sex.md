**Senate committee rejects pee for scholarships bill.** Sen. Gary Schroeder: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to reward somebody for (not) doing something that they can be arrested for.&#8221; Also, it could cost $45 million. $45 million in a rat hole, per Chairman Goedde. Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/320114.html). Miller, AP in the [Press Tribune](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/ID_XGR_DRUG_FREE_SCHOLARSHIPS_IDOL-?SITE=IDNCP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT).

**Sprawl bill passes Rev & Tax.** Narrowly. Allows developers to bond for infrastructure improvements. Boise Mayor Bieter: &#8220;Sometimes the only thing standing in the way of bad development is economics. This bill would remove that free-market stopgap and make bad growth more affordable. It would provide an upfront public subsidy for costs that are normally carried by developers.&#8221; Miller, AP in the [Press Tribune](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/ID_XGR_DEVELOPMENT_BONDS_IDOL-?SITE=IDNCP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT).

**Schools nudged on vending machines.** State asks schools to provide healthy snack and beverages. 20 opponents to the [resolution](http://www3.idaho.gov/oasis/HCR055.html) didn&#8217;t think it was the state&#8217;s business. But kids are fat. Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/320111.html). 

**New emissions standard could have major repercussions for Boise Valley.** Limit in parts per billion for ozone will be lowered tomorrow. 5 ppb could be a huge difference. Could bring loss of federal road funds, more expensive gas, controls on industry and, uh, bad air. Barker in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/320095.html).

**Boise Chamber of Commerce to endorse Constitutional Amendment for local option tax.** As long as local option bill goes through too. Ray Stark:“The chamber and others have worked hard on this legislation for nearly two and a half years.

**Less Joy in Sex at Nampa library.** Library board votes to keep two special books in the directors office for special requests. One 1st amendment defender to squeamish parents, fundamentalist crusaders: &#8220;Be parents, for God&#8217;s sake. Take care of your own kids. Don&#8217;t ask these people to do it.&#8221; Rodine in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/320096.html). Three library board members who voted to censor book appointed by Mayor Tom Dale. Butts in the [Press Tribune](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=4295).
