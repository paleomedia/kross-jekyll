Auditor reports that Idaho nuclear energy company future in doubt. Only $324,431 in assets remain for Alternate Energy Holdings, Inc., according to [Rotenberg and Co. audit](http://www.pinksheets.com/otciq/ajax/showFinancialReportById.pdf?id=16513). AP on [Forbes.com](http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/08/08/ap5305863.html). AEHI Spokesman Martin Johncox:&#8221;It&#8217;s not unusual for companies in a startup phase to lose money,&#8221; Johncox said. &#8220;Right now it&#8217;s hard to get financing for a house.&#8221; Poppino in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/08/09/news/local_state/142006.txt). Andrea Shipley, Snake River Alliance: “In fact, Mr. Buffett’s company, MidAmerican Energy said to the press that a commercial reactor in Idaho didn’t make economic sense. Mr. Gillispie simply hasn’t yet grasped that a commercial nuclear plant in Idaho is an economic, environmental, and energy loser.”
