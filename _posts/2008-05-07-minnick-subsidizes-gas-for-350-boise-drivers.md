**Congressional candidate Walt Minnick offered discounted gas to Boise drivers for about an hour Tuesday to highlight Rep. Bill Sali&#8217;s ties to oil and gas companies.** Idaho GOP, [Boise Weekly](http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A313627) call it a stunt. Minnick: “Idahoans are being pummeled at the pump while their congressman is hobnobbing with the very people who are getting filthy rich from high gas prices.” Sali spokesman Wayne Hoffman: &#8220;Radical environmentalists like Walt Minnick are directly responsible for the environmental policies that have given us high gas prices.&#8221; Kuraitis on [NewWest.net](http://www.newwest.net/city/article/minnick_holds_cheap_gas_event/C108/L108/).
