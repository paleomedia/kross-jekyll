It should be the last day of the Legislative session, not that that is a goal or something to be proud of or anything&#8230; but it is a relief. Now we can move on to stories about primary elections in just under two months.

Also stories about Canyon County&#8217;s impending decision on smogging, a look at Moyle&#8217;s power and a deconstruction of the veto&#8230; in today&#8217;s Newsrack&#8230;

**House rejects biz tax amendments.** Conference committee this morning to try to broker a deal. Maybe will settle on first $100,000 in value for exemption. Clark: $75,000 is &#8220;just an arbitrary number. Why isn&#8217;t it $1 million? Why isn&#8217;t it $2 million?&#8221; Russell in the [Spokesman](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/idaho/topstory.asp?ID=238618). Dems challenge Speaker&#8217;s authority, try vote on bill. Davidson in the [Post Register](http://www.postregister.com/story.php?accnum=1004-04022008&today=2008-04-02%2000:00:00) [subscrip].

**Big issues put aside Tuesday**. No vote on local option, state worker retirement, Constitutional amendment. Set to go home today. Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/340056.html). Modified primaries dead. No fooling at Annex. Hopkins in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/04/02/news/top_story/doc47f3128eed5aa583531413.txt). Insults on the House floor. Ferguson in the [LMT](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/17152/).

**Veto this.** A deconstruction of the veto power. Denney: &#8220;His perception is the Legislature cut something out of his budget so he cut something out of ours. I don&#8217;t remember what we did to his budget.&#8221; Hoffman in [BW](http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A312519).

**Emission testing bill becomes law.** Canyon Co. will have to do something in about 120 days. Non-attainment likely in the Boise Valley. [Press Tribune](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=7320).

**Otter signs grocery tax relief.** Otter: &#8220;I believe it&#8217;s got the money the quickest to the folks that need it the most.&#8221; Russell in the [Spokesman](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/idaho/story.asp?ID=238467).

**Frazier bill passed over.** Committee fails to vote on Constitutional change to make it easier for cities to bond. Frazier happy: &#8220;The highest court in the state of Idaho has told them they have to go to the voters. And they don&#8217;t like it. The cities and counties must keep their mitts out of our pockets &#8211; unless we allow them to stick them in there.&#8221; Miller, AP in the [Press Tribune](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/ID_XGR_CONSTITUTIONAL_AMENDMENT_DEBT_IDOL-?SITE=IDNCP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT).

**Moyle wins.** Repubs pass on challenging powerful West Ada Rep. Moyle: &#8220;I had three primaries before I got to the primary: I had Nancy, I had Winder, I had John Franden. Now I have three Democrats and that&#8217;s just fine.&#8221; Otter reccommends against Moyle Challenge, welcomes Bastian challenge. Popkey in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/340049.html).

**Minnick challenges Sali vote on Renewable Energy Tax.** Stumps at biofuel plant in Lewiston. Backs grants for renewables. David Cole in the [LMT](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/17150/).

**Henbest ducks out.** Henbest on triple espresso: &#8220;Nursing brings something really unique to that health-care debate. We don&#8217;t have a huge financial stake in it compared with other entities. We&#8217;re not these super-paid professionals, we&#8217;re not these &#8230; multi-billion-dollar companies.&#8221; Darr in the [BW](http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A312507).

**Blow by blow on Stone-Gillette tiff.** Stone: “In the jostling, his big white cowboy hat fell off. That suddenly diverted his attention to the hat on the snow. He picked it up and I said, ‘You just can&#8217;t do this to people.&#8217;” Kelly Jackson, [Wood River Journal](http://www.woodriverjournal.com/articles/2008/04/01/news/local_news/astory.txt).

**DeKlerk to U of I: ANC commies were more palatable without the USSR.** Former S. African president still coming up with new justifications for apartheid, end of apartheid, collecting speakers fees. Joel Mills in the [LM Tribune](http://www.lmtribune.com/story/northwest/17153/).

**High numbers of undiagnosed Hispanic AIDS patients showing up at hospitals.** Study looks at ways to catch them earlier, prevention. [Press Tribune.](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=7321)
