The main event Thursday was a minor squirming induced on the State Board of Education, members of which were forced to answer two hours of questioning by the Senate Education Committee. Board members held fast in their blaming of the staff.

Not asked, as far as Paleo can tell: Where has Idaho education come under the Board&#8217;s tenure. Just a forest and trees question.

The midwife licensing bill passed a sloppy Health and Welfare Committee meeting followed immediately by a sloppy abortion coercion bill.

And transportation fights have just begun&#8230; in today&#8217;s Newsrack.</p>

**State Board of Ed grilling lacks popcorn.** Board members continue to blame staff in 2-hour meeting before Senate Education Committee. Sen. Jorgenson: &#8220;The fact of the matter is &#8211; and the documents clearly show &#8211; that there were members of the board who had full and complete knowledge of what was going on and did nothing to stop it. Now, that&#8217;s a problem.&#8221; Hopkins in the [Times-News.](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/02/29/news/top_story/131843.txt) Miller, AP in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/02/29/ap-state-id/d8v3opt00.txt). **Milford out of the country.** Russell in the [Spokesman](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/idaho/topstory.asp?ID=234034) [partial access]. **Stone: It&#8217;s over.** Corey Taule in the [Post Register](http://www.postregister.com/story.php?accnum=1003-02292008&today=2008-02-29%2000:00:00) [subscrip].

**McGee, Senate irked by House transpo funding bills.** House members scrambling to get transportation funding proposals in after governor showed his cards this week.

**ISU&#8217;s Legoverleg.** Joshua Mayes: &#8220;In a world where literary journals are the cornerstone of success, I think they need a revolution to get art into people&#8217;s faces. To get them to create stuff, to feel comfortable creating stuff, to write a story that isn&#8217;t going to win the Booker Prize.&#8221; [State Journal](http://www.journalnet.com/articles/2008/02/29/news/breaking/news15.txt).
