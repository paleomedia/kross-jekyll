**Gov. Otter has no favorite in Meridian Senate primary battle.** Rep. Mark Snodgrass is challenging Sen. Shirley McKague, who was appointed to the Senate by Otter. Otter spokesman: &#8220;He has two friends in the race.&#8221; And Hartnett and Ellsworth in 18 both claim support from Cenarrusa. Former secretary of state likes Hartnett. Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/389509.html). And McKague botched the quote. [BW](http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A314100).
