To promote meaningful debate and public awareness about immigration, deportation and exile, we will be giving away copies of the </em>_**<a href="http://amzn.to/11dNDPd" target="_self">Amor and Exile</a>**_ free Kindle book on Thursday and Friday of this week!

Our Kindle version can be read on almost  [any computer, tablet or smartphone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000493771), not just on Kindles.

## Here&#8217;s the free Kindle book details:

  * **When**: Thursday, **January 23rd** through Friday, **January 24th** (48 hours!)

  * **What**: Download the **free** ebook for yourself or gift to a friend by clicking the &#8220;Give as a Gift&#8221; button on the Amazon page!

**NOTE**: We’d like to move thousands of copies of the book next week and need your help! The more books we move, the more the folks over at the Amazon book palace will notice our little work of nonfiction. This is the next phase in self-publishing. We are counting on our readers to rate, review and download our book so that the rest of the world has a chance of seeing it out there! 

Please plan to download a free Kindle book of _Amor and Exile_ from the Kindle store on Thursday and Friday, even if you already have a copy of the book! You can use it as a backup copy, gift to a friend or use it to beef up your digital library.
