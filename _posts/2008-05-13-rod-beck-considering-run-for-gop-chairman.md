**Kirk Sullivan wants third term at top of Idaho GOP but party activist Rod Beck may challenge him at the convention.** Beck has led the charge to close Idaho primary elections. Says the party is not pursuing the policy with enough gusto. Miller, AP in the [Press-Tribune](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/ID_CLOSED_PRIMARY_CHAIRMAN_IDOL-?SITE=IDNCP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT). And the party has not served it&#8217;s suit to close primaries on the state yet. Boone, AP in the [Press-Tribune](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/ID_ELECTION_LAWSUIT_IDOL-?SITE=IDNCP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT).
