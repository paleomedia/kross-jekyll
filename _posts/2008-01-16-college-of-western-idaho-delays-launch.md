Dennis Griffin, president of the now-forming [College of Western Idaho](http://www.cwidaho.cc/) told the state budget committee Wednesday that he feels like a puppy with big paws and too many masters giving him conflicting advice and commands.

Since approved by voters on May 22, the new community college has gotten a [board](http://www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/story/136588.html), set up shop at Boise State&#8217;s Nampa campus, hired a skeleton staff of VPs, called some other community colleges for advice&#8230;<!--more-->

But the board has also decided not to start classes on time. 

&#8220;It became obvious we couldn&#8217;t get that done that fast,&#8221; Griffin told the Legislative budget committee.

CWI will start some basic education and non-credit classes almost immediately, but will open officially in Jan &#8217;09, running the Larry Selland College for Boise State University. It will eventually assume complete operations over the two-year college that is now part of Boise State.

CWI will hire 40 part time faculty and 20 full time profs next fall in preparation for the &#8217;09 launch. The college district intended to ask Ada and Canyon county residents for $4 million in tax funds but will only levy $2 million for &#8217;08 because of the delayed launch date, Griffin said.

Still, CWI would like to receive a $5 million state appropriation and $100,000 boost in liquor fund contributions to community colleges. Budget writers appeared amenable to the funding, though they asked Griffin to repeat the figures a number of times until he read them correctly into the record.

Sen. Elliot Werk suggested after the meeting that Boise State University, with the Selland College, is like a Chinese restaurant in Trona, California: it has everything from chow mein to cheese burgers and is not going to do any of them particularly well. Transferring some two-year functions to CWI will allow both institutions to better fulfill their missions.
