**Amtrak CEO Alex Kummant tells delegation he&#8217;ll visit Idaho if Congress authorizes train funding.** Crapo, Simpson support return of Pioneer Route. Kummant (via Crapo): &#8220;I will make it a personal priority of mine to visit your home state and learn firsthand of the opportunities that exist in Idaho and other western states for expanded intercity passenger rail service.&#8221; Hopkins in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/11/10/news/local_state/148469.txt).
