**From Caldwell, blogging at Voices.IdahoStatesman.com (do I hear voices?), Prof. Jasper LiCalzi handicaps the Treasure Valley races.** LiCalzi is [not afraid to be wrong](http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2008/05/20/licalzi/hot_races_in_the_treasure_valley_part_1). He calls Canyon County for Bowers (who had someone knock on his door), Thayn who may benefit from a split vote and a possible upset in Olvera&#8217;s challenge to the entrenched Bob Schaefer.

[In Ada](http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2008/05/21/licalzi/hot_races_in_the_treasure_valley_part_2), the prof thinks Merrill&#8217;s write-in has little chance, likes Winder in the District 14 Senate race (NOTE: Henry Kulczyk is no longer running. I just called him and he said he&#8217;s not running for &#8220;personal reasons&#8221;. And, prof: it&#8217;s McDavid, not McDaniel&#8230;). Also, Hartnett with housing slump money bags and Snodgrass-McKague too close to call&#8230;
