**Boise Democrat Matt Yost filed suit against the Secretary of State hoping to get a spot on the District 15 ballot.** Yost was disqualified in the District 15 Senate race against John Andreason because Sec. Ysursa deemed him unqualified for failure to register to vote in the district a year in advance. Yost attorney: &#8220;The analysis wrongfully bootstraps the &#8216;qualified elector&#8217; status necessary for voting into the qualifications necessary to be a member of the state Senate.&#8221; Boone, AP in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/04/30/ap-state-id/d90bra400.txt).
