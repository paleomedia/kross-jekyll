**Gergory [Nemitz](http://www.nemitz.net/) suggests $1 billion government prize to best Mars space colony.** Rep. Mike Simpson has never had a GOP challenger since he was elected in 1998. [Nemitz](http://www.beefjerky.com/) is on the Ron Paul tix, wants cuts to Dept. of Education, multiple currencies, quick end to war in Iraq (but not political withdrawal). [Jack Wayne Chappell](http://www.amazon.com/Wilderness-Rape-Jack-Wayne-Chappell/dp/0961497408) is the anti-CIEDRA candidate, promoting his book. Simpson: &#8220;To get anything done there are things we&#8217;re working on. There are things that take a long time to do. I&#8217;ve been working on CIEDRA for seven years. It&#8217;s just one of those things that just take a long time. To say we just need change, that&#8217;s almost sounding like Barack Obama.&#8221; Hopkins in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/05/15/news/local_state/136762.txt).
