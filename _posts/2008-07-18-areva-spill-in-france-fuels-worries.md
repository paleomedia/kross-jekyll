**Areva enrichment plant in France spilled 7,925 gallons of unenriched uranium into two rivers this month.** The same Areva that is planning to build a plant near Idaho Falls. Company says it&#8217;s a totally different situation: Areva-Idaho will not do reconversion of H6, only enrichment. Snake River Alliance not so sure: &#8220;These sorts of wastes have a half-life of hundreds-of-thousands of years, and Idaho really needs to be thoughtful as it thinks about the kind of economic and energy development we want to bring into this state.‚Äù Zach Hagadone at [IBR](http://www.idahobusiness.net/archive.htm/2008/07/15/AREVA-France-leak-renews-nuke-safety-concerns).
