**Ada County Ron Paul supporters will unite with Rod Beck at state GOP convention.** Rep. Labrador supports deposing Sullivan: “There is some dissatisfaction with the chairman. And I think the dissatisfaction breeds some weird marriages.” Miller, AP in the [Press Tribune](http://www.idahopress.com/?id=10754). Also, Ron Paul Supporters in CDA and TF are in as delegates to state convention, but not in charge of the county parties. Kootenai Paulie Wisniewski: &#8220;What I am seeing at the county level is what they talked about in terms of Soviet-style elections.&#8221; In CDA they tried to get a do-over election.
