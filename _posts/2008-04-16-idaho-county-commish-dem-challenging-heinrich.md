**Idaho County commissioner Randy Doman will challenge Sen. Lee Heinrich in November.** Doman: &#8220;And let&#8217;s not forget that good government requires personal integrity and truly serving the community, not serving oneself or those who contribute to your staying in office.&#8221; Heinrich: &#8220;I now have two sessions under my belt and I believe that makes me much more effective as a legislator.&#8221; [Idaho County Free Press](http://www.idahocountyfreepress.com/IFPNews1.shtml).
