And Power County Sheriff Jim Jeffries says he may be forced to **outsource meals at County Jail**, ending a long relationship with local food stores. “Historically the jail hasn’t had a professional cook,” Jeffries said. “That’s how it has been done for decades.

Otter, tribes reach **last minute fuel tax agreement**. &#8220;Entering into the agreement was a difficult decision for the Nez Perce Tribe because of the issues created by the passage of the legislation during the 2007 session,&#8221; Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee Chairman Samuel N.
