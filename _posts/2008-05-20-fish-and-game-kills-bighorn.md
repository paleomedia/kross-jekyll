**Fish and Game shot a lone ram this month after he mixed with domestic goats along the Little Salmon.** First use of lethal policy approved by Otter late last year. Biologist: “We decided we’d better take care of him before he goes back and mixes with other bighorns.” BHS that mix with domestic sheep and goats can spread disease.
