  They say imitation is the highest form of flattery... And on the internet we wholeheartedly agree! The Statesman has adopted PaleoMedia.org's Newsrack concept for <a href="http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2008/04/04/idahonewsreader/welcome_to_water_season">herself</a>. They call it the News Reader. May they have much nachas on their MSM pinchas's...

They say imitation is the highest form of flattery&#8230; And on the internet I wholeheartedly agree. The Statesman has adopted PaleoMedia.org&#8217;s Newsrack concept for [herself](http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2008/04/04/idahonewsreader/welcome_to_water_season). They call it the News Reader.

We stole the idea from [Rough and Tumble](http://rtumble.com) and Slate&#8217;s [Today&#8217;s Papers](http://www.slate.com/id/2188238/). So that&#8217;s cool.

And David Parker has some fine links this morning including an interview with [Dirk](http://www.usnews.com/blogs/the-inside-job/2008/04/03/finished-sentences-interiors-dirk-kempthorne.html) and, well, that&#8217;s the most interesting one.

So we&#8217;re taking the day off. PaleoMedia 2.0 coming next week. ðŸ˜‰
