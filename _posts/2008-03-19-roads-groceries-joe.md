A grocery tax compromise brokered by House leaders is breaking through, but transportation bills are stuck, with even more &#8220;new ideas&#8221; in the works at this late date. Meanwhile, the House Rev & Tax folks are going to look at just a handful more exemptions after \*shocking\* news that cutting both grocery and personal property taxes could hurt the budget a few years down the road. 

Two reviews of legislation that affects cities and counties today, Pro-Life is also a position, Ron Paul&#8217;s ballot position and a Taser death in today&#8217;s Newsrack&#8230;

**Legislators give local government the shaft.** By most accounts. Rep.
