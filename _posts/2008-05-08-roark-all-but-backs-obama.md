**Chairman of the Idaho Democratic Party Keith Roark all but backed Obama Wednesday after the N. Carolina/Indiana primaries.** But last undeclared superdelegado in Idaho not quite decided. Roark: &#8220;I was impressed with Obama&#8217;s performance last night. That went a long way to settling my concerns and showed he could snap back and take a punch.&#8221; Hopkins in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/05/08/news/local_state/136324.txt).
