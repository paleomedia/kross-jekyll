excerpt: |
  Russell takes a look at how the State Board of Education go to where it finds itself today: broke and leaderless. The story foreshadows a possible shift in power back to the department under Tom Luna.<p>
  
  Also, Ada County's sheriff is looking at training deputies to assess immigration cases and the NRA seems a bit confused about federal land designations in the Statesman's washington bureau report on Crapo's guns on federal land push.
