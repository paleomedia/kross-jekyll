  The House held its nose and voted for some food tax relief Thursday, giving Otter a little something. Meanwhile, some competing road funding bills gained initial approval and a deal on local option taxing was burned on CD. <p />
  
  Owners of what Otter calls half-way houses are pressuring the governor to veto a bill that lets cities control where they locate and threatening a federal lawsuit if it becomes law. NIMBY at it's best. <p />
  
  Fish and Game commissioners are in town and approved the state wolf plan and more election announcements coming all the time... Maybe even on PaleoMedia.org... in the <a href="http://www.paleomedia.org/2008/03/07/grocery-tax-mansfield-suit-primary-jig/">Newsrack</a>...
