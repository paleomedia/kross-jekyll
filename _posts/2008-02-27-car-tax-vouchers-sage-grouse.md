Gov. Otter&#8217;s people proposed several large tax hikes Tuesday to pay for road work in Idaho. The bills still have to be introduced in one the the privileged committees before they are debated. Meanwhile, [Canyon County mayors](http://www.idahopress.com/cms/artwork/articleimages/1497.jpg) are riding the bus.

A school voucher plan was introduced to some intense discussion begging editorial cartoonage, SPTD. Luna&#8217;s teacher merit pay lite passes Senate committee, sage grouse ESA review begins again&#8230; in today&#8217;s [Newsrack](http://www.paleomedia.org/2008/02/27/car-tax-vouchers-sage-grouse/). 

And on the docket this morning: gun and lobby reform, repeal of Idaho&#8217;s in-state labor first law for the Capitol could be up for debate in the Senate and later, Pre-K gets a once over [see [Unda](http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A311502)&#8216; for details].

**Flat rig registration fee gets mixed welcome.** Otter wants to raise the car <del datetime="2008-02-27T13:04:34+00:00">tax</del> fee to a flat $150 for state, plus current county charges. Could nearly quadruple registration cost in Ada. Also proposes rental car tax, trucker fees and shifting ISP budget. Druzin in the [Statesman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/newsupdates/story/307462.html). **Would raise $202 million.** Rep. King: &#8220;My neighbor who is 90 years old drives very little.

**It&#8217;s called vouchers.** Rep. Vander Woude wants tax break (up to about $400) for private school parents. Like the Christian school on whose board he sat. &#8220;This is not an overly large tax break for the wealthy.&#8221; Rep.

**Pee in a cup for college.** Students who pledge not to smoke up and prove it get scholarships. According to bill that passed the House Tuesday. Rep. Barrett has a point: &#8220;What&#8217;s next? Will we pay college kids with money if they don&#8217;t rob a bank or steal a car? We are telling our young people we don&#8217;t trust them to obey the law and don&#8217;t believe that a drug-free life is an end in itself.&#8221; Shifrin, AP in the [Press Tribune](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/ID_XGR_DRUG_FREE_SCHOLARSHIPS_IDOL-?SITE=IDNCP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT).
