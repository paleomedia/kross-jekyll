Gov. C. L. &#8220;Butch&#8221; Otter was back in the office this morning presiding over a meeting of the State Land Board. It was his first day in the office since he had his right hip resurfaced on Jan. 29.

Otter stood to stretch a few times during the meeting and at one point declined an offer of coffee from Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Luna, preferring to walk over to the coffee bar on his own. He was in good spirits throughout the meeting, joking about how long the Legislature might be in town and gaveling Attorney General Lawrence Wasden down in jest.

After the meeting Otter said he was back, but might be heading home early.

&#8220;We&#8217;ll see how long it lasts,&#8221; Otter said as he was ushered from the second story court room at the old Borah Building.

Otter was expected to tap into the meeting by phone Thursday morning from his ranch in Star from whence he has been conducting the state&#8217;s business. But he showed up in person instead. The Board had two significant issues to deal with &#8211; a grazing lease and state land lease &#8211; both of which were put deferred for further study.
