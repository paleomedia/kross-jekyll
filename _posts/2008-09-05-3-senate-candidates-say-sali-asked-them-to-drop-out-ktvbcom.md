**Sali called Pro-Life, Marmon, maybe Rammell, to ask them to drop out of Senate race.** Sali&#8217;s Hoffman concerned: &#8220;This isn&#8217;t about them, this is about the Democrats trying to use the number of people on the ballot to their advantage, they are making an effort to win not only Bill Sali&#8217;s seat, but the seat that Jim Risch is running for and it&#8217;s a big concern.&#8221; Ysabel Bilbao on[KTVB](http://www.ktvb.com/news/localnews/stories/ktvbn-sep0408-senate_candidates.445239f9.html).
