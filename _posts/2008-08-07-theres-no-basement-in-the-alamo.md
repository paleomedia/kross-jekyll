**Prof: &#8220;He gets killed, but he stands for what he believes in.&#8221;** Sali likened to Davy Crockett at the Alamo after opposing bridge safety act. Minnick: &#8220;He&#8217;s part of the lunatic fringe. My guess is, almost 100 percent of the people of Idaho want structurally deficient bridges repaired as soon as we can.&#8221; Sali spokesman: &#8220;The problem with this bill is that it actually ties the hands of the states that have to deal with this issue.&#8221; Miller, AP in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/08/07/ap-state-id/d92d62h81.txt).
