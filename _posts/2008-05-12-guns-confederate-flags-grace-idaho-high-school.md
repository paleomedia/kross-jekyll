**Following an alleged racial incident in which a white teacher confiscated and trashed a Mexican flag, a Rupert high school is embroiled in immigration politics.** One student was arrested, others brought Confederate flags to school and rumors of guns have scared some parents into keeping their kids home. Latino students marched last week. Latino student: &#8220;On Monday people are still going to remember what happened. Everyone&#8217;s going to remember until next year, but I&#8217;m hoping people will let it drop.&#8221; Greene in the [Times-News](http://www.magicvalley.com/articles/2008/05/10/news/local_state/136446.txt).
