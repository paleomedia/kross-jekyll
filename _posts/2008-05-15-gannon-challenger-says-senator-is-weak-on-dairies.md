**Doran Parkins says Sen. Tom Gannon may not have the support of the dairy industry.** Gannon shocked: &#8220;I would call that bunk&#8230; I have not heard that and nor have I ever been confronted with that accusation, and I resent it.&#8221; It&#8217;s the only contested primary in south-central.

Parkins on Pre-K: &#8220;I think the homes can do that.&#8221; And Gannon: &#8220;The hard-line critics, such as him, subscribe to the position that the child belongs at home and it&#8217;s the parents&#8217; responsibility &#8211; which I don&#8217;t think anybody would disagree with in a perfect world.
