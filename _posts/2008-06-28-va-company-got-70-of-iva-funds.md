**Times-News: Idaho Virtual Academy sent 70% 0f it&#8217;s budget to a school management company in Virginia.** A Times-News investigation showed that lots of charter, virtual school money is going to out-of-state corporations, which have an increasing influence on the Idaho State Department of Education. Corporate execs sit on local school boards and on a newly formed teacher compensation committee. School choice advocates sit on out-of-state education corps with contracts in Idaho. And the public does not really know where the money is going. And the Department of Ed is OK with that.
