Most papers lead this morning with stories of wolf delisting, a 13-year saga that has brought back one of the most emblematic species of the West. The road ahead is not clear with battles looming in court and in the field. 

A bill that opens up testimony at CAFO hearings at the county level is headed to the full Senate, but could get tied up in the House again. Tamarack troubles continue. Schools Chief pitches his modified teacher merit pay plan. And it was, in fact, an earthquake felt across southern Idaho yesterday.

And in case you have not [picked up Unda&#8217;](http://www.boiseweekly.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A311329) yet, the John Birch Society is still kickin&#8217;&#8230; in Friday&#8217;s [Newsrack](http://www.paleomedia.org/2008/02/22/wolves-dairy-testimony-quake/)&#8230;

I&#8217;m conscious of where we are and I would say that these both are rightly respected institutions, but the fact is in the 1960s and 1970s they were not doing their job.&#8221; Scouts: Recognize, resist, report. Boone, AP in the [Argus Observer](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/ID_SCOUTS_ABUSE_SUIT_IDOL-?SITE=ORONT&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT). Statesman, other media held story until suit was filed.
