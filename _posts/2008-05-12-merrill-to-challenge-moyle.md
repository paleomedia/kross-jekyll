**Nancy Merrill, former Eagle mayor, is running a write-in campaign against Mike Moyle.** Merrill was thought to be interested in the District 14 seat, but she failed to file for election, citing family concerns. Now the Statesman says she&#8217;s running. Merrill: &#8220;I decided to finish what I started. We need experienced representation, and I have an 18-year record of consensus-building and getting things done.&#8221; Talbutt, [Stateman](http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/378423.html).
